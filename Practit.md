SmartStart 10-Year Report Interview: Franchisor Perspectives (Tafara Shuro)
Date: Fri, Feb 13, 2026

1. Joining the journey
"Take me back to when you first became a SmartStart franchisor. What was happening in your context at the time and what made you decide to join?"
Probe if needed: What alternatives did you consider? What concerns did you have?
Response
When we joined SmartStart, our organisation (Siyakholwa) had been working in community development for many years in the Eastern Cape—things like farming projects, public employment/community works programmes, and general initiatives to improve people’s lives. The Eastern Cape context is tough: high unemployment, low education outcomes, and heavy reliance on grants. We had only run one ECD programme for about a year before SmartStart, so we were still new to the ECD space and didn’t fully understand what the work would involve.
What attracted us was how SmartStart could quickly create opportunities—especially for community women—to stimulate young children and put them on a better path early in life. Even though we didn’t know all the details, our mindset was: let’s try, learn, and see how it works.
(Probe – alternatives/concerns):
Before SmartStart, we had tried a programme called Brain Boosters in one area (Kaiskamahoek). We thought it was good, but it was expensive and difficult to scale. SmartStart felt simpler, more scalable, and came with structured coaching and support, so it made sense to move in that direction.

2. Early reality
"What were the first 6-12 months like in practice? What turned out to be harder than you expected? What surprised you?"
Probe if needed: Was there a moment you thought, 'This might not work'?
Response
In the early months, community access itself wasn’t the hardest part for us because we already had relationships through other programmes. What was difficult was entering what felt like a “protected space” in ECD. Some ECD forums and established practitioners felt threatened by SmartStart and saw it as competition or a disruptor. That created mistrust and made it hard to explain that we were not trying to replace anyone—we were trying to expand access to quality early learning.
We also struggled at times to navigate relationships with the department and gatekeepers, because we were still new in the sector and didn’t always know how to move in those systems.
Another surprise was around recruitment. We worked with Harambee and many candidates were young women. While they valued the opportunity, some weren’t ready for what it actually meant to run a programme/business. Once they understood what SmartStart required in practice, some dropped out after training.

3. Seeing impact
"Can you describe a moment when you realised this work was making a real difference for children, practitioners, or communities?"
Probe if needed: What changed before and after that moment?
Response 
My first powerful moment came when I was involved as a trainer—I was part of the first group of male trainers accredited in SmartStart. In the training room, I watched practitioners’ mindsets shift. When we challenged some of the “hard-wired” beliefs people grew up with, you could literally see the lights switch on.
There was an activity (the “flower activity” at the time) that was very emotional and sometimes surfaced trauma we didn’t expect, but it also brought healing and empowerment. Before that shift, many people were used to being told what to do in a rigid way. After that moment, they began to understand learning through play and how to involve children actively in their learning.
Later, when I visited centres of practitioners I had trained, I could see the difference in practice—children more engaged, more stimulated, and better outcomes. But for me, it started with that change in the practitioner first.

4. Shaping the platform
"SmartStart describes franchisors as leaders who helped shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how SmartStart works today?"
Probe if needed: Something you questioned, adapted, or improved?
Response 
What stood out to me is that SmartStart has always behaved like a learning organisation. As trainers and franchisors, we would test things on the ground, then come back and share what worked and what didn’t. SmartStart took that feedback seriously—often you would see it reflected later in the manuals or the way training was delivered.
Over time, it has also shifted to empower franchisors more, instead of everything being driven from the centre. The most important part is that people on the ground feel heard—trainers, coaches, franchisors, and franchisees. There are intentional spaces created for feedback, and that bottom-up approach is part of why the platform has been able to grow and improve. I often describe it as “building the bus while we’re driving it.”

5. Entry into communities
"Much of SmartStart's reach came from franchisors opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?"
Probe if needed: Who did you have to convince? What mattered most?
Response 
In many places we had an advantage because we already worked in those communities through other programmes, including Community Works in multiple municipalities and infrastructure support for ECDs, schools, and community halls. That existing presence made it easier to introduce SmartStart.
But when we entered new areas where we didn’t already operate, trust-building took more effort. What mattered was identifying the key stakeholders first—traditional leaders, councillors, local officials, and community structures—and engaging them intentionally. I learned that confusion creates friction, so it’s important to clearly explain what SmartStart is, what we’re trying to achieve, and what the short- and long-term goals are. Once we did that consistently, entry became easier over time.

6. Practitioners' growth
"Thinking about the practitioners you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally or personally?"
Probe if needed: A specific practitioner story?
Response 
I’ve learned that people grow differently. Some are naturally driven and ambitious, and others are comfortable staying small—maybe serving six to eight children and keeping things stable. What’s important is meeting practitioners where they are and working with their strengths.
I’ve seen the same training lead to very different outcomes depending on the person. One example is a practitioner in Mdantsane who didn’t seem very committed during training, but later grew into someone running a thriving, larger centre. Seeing that kind of transformation—from training, to visits, to quality assessments, to watching her confidence and delivery improve—reminds me that there is real potential in people when the right support unlocks it.
Some practitioners have progressed to registered centres and achieved different levels (like bronze and silver). They’re not all in the same place, but it’s powerful to see how a small opportunity can change a person’s life over time.

7. Children and families
"Can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?"
Probe if needed: What stands out about that story for you?
Response 
One story that stays with me is about Dipuo Solani in Mdantsane. I trained her early on (I was a co-trainer at the time). Years later, she had built a large centre with more than 30 children, and the local school trusted her so much that they wanted her to start a centre on their premises. The community could see the difference in the children she supported. Parents notice when their children grow in confidence and learning.
What stands out is that the work clearly works—there’s no debate for me about that. The real question is sustainability: how do we ensure these practitioners are supported long-term, especially by communities themselves, so they don’t burn out? Practitioners like Dipuo are the “heroes” in their communities, and if communities take ownership and back them, we can build healthier futures.

8. Hidden challenges
"What is the hardest part of being a franchisor that people outside SmartStart often don't see or understand?"
Probe if needed: What support is still missing?
Response 
The hardest part is seeing needs that fall outside our current capacity—especially children’s hunger. SmartStart’s core focus is quality early learning and school readiness, but when you visit centres and children are hungry, it’s heartbreaking because stimulation alone can’t solve that. I remember visiting a practitioner who said parents were leaving children with her as long as possible, hoping she would feed them because there was no food at home. That stayed with me. Nutrition is a major gap that requires broader partnership.
Another hidden challenge is dealing with systems where progress is slowed by gatekeeping or lack of urgency. I respect regulations, but sometimes it feels like there isn’t enough agency across stakeholders to act quickly enough. If other partners—government and others—played their roles more effectively, it would amplify what SmartStart is already doing.

9. Learning over time
"What have you learned over the past 10 years about early learning, communities, leadership, or yourself?"
Probe if needed: Something you had to unlearn?
Response 
About early learning: I’ve learned that you don’t always need a perfect system to start—sometimes you need a minimum “dosage” that gets things moving. Certification matters, but SmartStart has shown that starting with a strong, practical minimum can still create real impact. I’ve also learned there’s power in partnership—ECD is big enough for everyone, and collaboration will close the access gap faster than competition.
About communities: Trust takes time, but once communities understand what you’re doing and how they can be part of the solution, they support it. I’ve also learned that NGOs often arrive thinking they have the answers, but communities may have better, homegrown solutions—if we listen properly. SmartStart has shown me how solutions can be created organically with communities, for communities.
About leadership: Leadership is less about prescribing and more about listening and serving. The kind of “status leadership” we sometimes associate with leadership is not what works in community development. Real leadership is about creating the conditions for bottom-up solutions to emerge and helping surface what’s already there.
About myself: I’ve learned I need more patience, and I’ve had to unlearn perfectionism. Community work doesn’t move the way corporate environments do, and making it about the vision—rather than my personal standards—matters more. I’ve also learned how deeply I care about people and love seeing them grow. More recently, I’ve learned the importance of thinking about scale from the beginning, because it’s hard to retrofit scalability later.

10. Pride
"When you look back over the decade, what makes you most proud of your role in SmartStart?"
Response
I’m most proud that I took a risk and entered something I didn’t fully understand. It wasn’t comfortable, but I chose to try anyway. That attitude—personally and organisationally—opened up learning and growth.
This has been the most exciting and impactful work I’ve ever been part of. The proud moments come when I visit centres and see children being stimulated and developing—because it feels like, in a real and practical way, we are contributing to change.

11. Looking ahead
"As SmartStart looks toward the next decade, what do you think franchisors will need in order to succeed at even greater scale?"
Response 
To scale, the roles and the relationship between the SmartStart hub and franchisors will need to change significantly. The support model can’t stay the same if we want a completely different level of reach. Franchisors will need to think differently—moving from operating in a few communities to thinking at a provincial level changes everything.
If we want to reach something like a million children per year, we can’t simply replicate what we did over the past ten years. That will require difficult change management—people may want to keep things the same, but structures and roles will need to shift. Funding will also need to look different: franchisors may need to mobilise resources themselves rather than relying on the hub to channel funding.

12. In your own words
"If you could say one thing to South Africa about what SmartStart has achieved, what would it be?"
Response 
I would say South Africans should look beyond the numbers and notice the work happening behind closed doors—SmartStart’s advocacy, policy influence, and the sacrifices made to shift the ECD system. We often see the results but not the effort and time spent influencing government and shaping the future of early childhood development.
SmartStart is a major player in the ECD space, and I believe South Africa should support it—because with the right support, we will see the transformation the country needs.





Franchisors Interview 3L Development
Facilitator: Thabisile Zuma
Respondents: Suzette Cronje; Darcelle Warnick (James); Phakiso Booysen
Organisation: 3L Development / SmartStart
Conducted 28 January 2026	13:00- 14:00																		
1. Joining the journey
Question:
"Take me back to when you first became a SmartStart franchisor. What was happening in your context at the time and what made you decide to join?"
Probe if needed: What alternatives did you consider? What concerns did you have?
Response: Suzette Cronje:
Before SmartStart, 3L Development had already shifted focus into early childhood development. We didn’t run crèches, we worked through playgroups in family homes, with a strong household development focus. We also ran the ECD work through the CWP (Community Works Programme), placing participants into playgroup roles. Our playgroup curriculum is registered with the Department of Education and Social Development.
When SmartStart emerged, funders introduced it to us. I applied because it aligned with our work and offered a way to reach more children.
Darcelle Warnick:
When we became a SmartStart franchisor, we started with playgroups in Francis Baard district, about 50 playgroups initially. Some of those original franchisees are still part of the programme today. Over time, we expanded SmartStart into three other districts as well.

2. Early reality
Question:
"What were the first 6-12 months like in practice? What turned out to be harder than you expected? What surprised you?"
Probe if needed: Was there a moment you thought, 'This might not work'?
Darcelle Warnick:
In the beginning, I was the only coach. We already had CWP playgroups running, so we recruited some new ones and converted older playgroups into SmartStart. The main challenge was adjusting to the SmartStart value chain and processes.
Our own programme was already registered and our facilitators were already trained, so the transition wasn’t difficult in terms of content. The programmes were aligned. The bigger adjustment was learning the franchise model and how SmartStart operates.
3. Seeing impact
Question:
"Can you describe a moment when you realised this work was making a real difference for children, practitioners, or communities?"
Probe if needed: What changed before and after that moment?
Darcelle Warnick:
A key moment is when franchisees receive resources, especially the “big purple bag.” You can see how valued and supported they feel. Another impact was the formal child progress tracking: parents began receiving structured feedback on their child’s development within months, and parents appreciated being informed about progress.
Suzette Cronje:
Schools began asking where these children were coming from because they noticed a difference in school readiness. Parents also gave strong feedback — some were emotional because their children were learning shapes and concepts they themselves hadn’t learned. The impact extended to parents’ learning too.
Phakiso Booysen:
In the training itself you see impact: in the first five days, franchisees absorb a lot and their confidence grows. If you meet them again after three months of running the programme, you can clearly see personal and professional growth and a shift in mindset.

4. Shaping the platform
Question:
"SmartStart describes franchisors as leaders who helped shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how SmartStart works today?"
Probe if needed: Something you questioned, adapted, or improved?
Suzette Cronje:
The SmartStart value chain was new for us, but it improved our work. Overall, we didn’t experience major problems. The systems helped.
Phakiso Booysen:
I’ve observed that SmartStart provides strong support systems for franchisees, including tools like the Funda app. There is consistent effort from the hub to improve. Seeing this has influenced how we think about strengthening our own recruitment and value chain processes as 3L.
Suzette Cronje:
Communication has improved significantly across the system, between franchisors, franchisees, and the hub, through WhatsApp groups, “Week of the Stars,” and other initiatives.

5. Entry into communities
Question:
"Much of SmartStart's reach came from franchisors opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?"
Probe if needed: Who did you have to convince? What mattered most?
Suzette Cronje:
We have been doing community development work in the Northern Cape for almost 30 years, so we are well known and entry is generally not difficult. We ensure ward councillors and relevant local committees know us, and we also engage cultural leaders. Having the blessing of community leadership is key.
Phakiso Booysen:
Our prior CWP work helped build relationships and networks in communities. There is still a large need across the Northern Cape, but so far access hasn’t been a major challenge because we already have established connections.
Suzette Cronje:
A key challenge is distance: the Northern Cape is vast. Some playgroups had to close because funding is not sufficient to cover travel into deep rural areas — even though those areas are where the need is greatest.

6. Practitioners' growth
Question:
"Thinking about the practitioners you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally or personally?"
Probe if needed: A specific practitioner story?
Darcelle Warnick:
In the beginning, some playgroups were “window dressing”. Toys were packed away because practitioners feared children would break them. Through coaching, workshops, and coaching circles, practitioners shifted their mindset and understood that children learn through play. Now they use toys actively and even create additional learning materials from recycled resources.
We also saw growth in business ownership: some franchisees initially expected to be spoon-fed. Through business skills training they began seeing the playgroup as their business. Many improved their environments, moving from just a mat to tables, chairs, outdoor play areas, and welcoming boards showing themes and daily information.
We also encouraged household gardens: franchisees began growing vegetables and feeding children through produce from these gardens.
Phakiso Booysen:
The biggest shift happens when franchisees develop a sense of ownership, when they stop seeing it as SmartStart’s programme and start seeing it as their early learning programme. When that happens, they invest more and the quality of programmes improves significantly.

7. Children and families
Question:
"Can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?"
Probe if needed: What stands out about that story for you?
Darcelle Warnick:
In Kuruman we worked in rural villages with tribal leadership structures, where you must gain permission to operate. These communities often have no access to ECD services and are far from towns.
In one village (Kgana?), the tribal leader saw the difference the playgroup made, children’s behaviour improved and parents reported positive changes. Within about a year and a half, the tribal leader mobilised the community to build a physical ECD centre for the playgroup. Community members made bricks and contributed collectively, resulting in a large ECD structure.

8. Hidden challenges
Question:
"What is the hardest part of being a franchisor that people outside SmartStart often don't see or understand?"
Probe if needed: What support is still missing?
Suzette Cronje:
The biggest challenge is meeting needs on the ground in a context of vast distances. People at the hub may not fully understand field realities. Activities like PQAs take several hours, and travel to reach a site can take hours each way. This limits how many sites you can support in a day. The reality on the ground doesn’t always align neatly with the franchise value chain expectations.
Darcelle Warnick:
For example, a PQA in a far site can require driving 350km (about 3.5 hours) each way. It’s not efficient to travel that far for a single activity, but there is often no budget for accommodation to stay over and combine activities like club meetings the next day.
Phakiso Booysen:
Distance remains the biggest issue. Another challenge is retention: franchisees struggle to collect fees in high-poverty communities. When stipends end or funding shifts, some playgroups collapse and franchisees leave for other opportunities. These are solvable challenges, but they need intentional planning.
Darcelle Warnick:
Distance also affects timely completion of value chain activities, such as annual reaccreditation, sometimes you can only reach sites later than planned.

9. Learning over time
Question:
"What have you learned over the past 10 years about early learning, communities, leadership, or yourself?"
Probe if needed: Something you had to unlearn?
Phakiso Booysen:
I learned that children learn through play. I didn’t fully understand it before, but now I see that play can be enjoyable while also enabling deep learning.
Darcelle Warnick:
Personally, I learned the importance of maintaining relationships — with franchisees, coaches, franchisors, programme leads, and stakeholders. This was difficult for me at first, but SmartStart’s network and communication structures helped me grow in that area.
Suzette Cronje:
SmartStart introduced formal systems, templates, tools, and processes. That helped us strengthen our evidence and documentation. SmartLink in particular forced us to be more organised and submit evidence consistently, which supported our development.
Darcelle Warnick:
I strongly agree about SmartLink. It taught me discipline: doing work on time and uploading evidence on time. It keeps us accountable and on track.

10. Pride
Question:
"When you look back over the decade, what makes you most proud of your role in SmartStart?"
Suzette Cronje:
As a founder, I’m proud that the work has continued for 10 years and continues improving. It’s meaningful to see something you helped establish become stronger over time and gain more attention for ECD.
Darcelle Warnick:
I’m proud that I’ve grown through different roles — from coach to programme lead, and also managing finances — which helped me understand the network deeply. I’m also proud of national recognition: one of my franchisees’ testimonies was showcased on SABC2 and also during SmartStart Unite, highlighting the impact of the work.
Phakiso Booysen:
I share in the pride of the work being done. I’m proud of the mindset shift that happens in franchisees during training. They begin to understand how early learning impacts a child’s future and even the future of the country. It’s powerful to be part of that movement.

11. Looking ahead
Question:
"As SmartStart looks toward the next decade, what do you think franchisors will need in order to succeed at even greater scale?"
Darcelle Warnick:
We need provincial hubs with accessible support, including dedicated IT support capacity in provinces. That would increase productivity and responsiveness.
Suzette Cronje:
SmartStart needs to make stronger provision for reaching rural areas. Most provinces are vast and rural, unlike Gauteng, and those rural areas are where the need is greatest. Franchisors need support for transport and accommodation so rural work is feasible.
Phakiso Booysen:
I agree about reaching remote areas. Franchisees also need empowerment beyond training (including formal qualifications). This could improve retention and sustainability, so franchisees don’t collapse when stipends or funding end.

12. In your own words
Question:
"If you could say one thing to South Africa about what SmartStart has achieved, what would it be?"
Suzette Cronje:
SmartStart has established a strong and solid programme. Because it focused on areas where growth could happen effectively, the programme strengthened and developed well.
Darcelle Warnick:
Through SmartStart, strong foundations are built in a child’s life.
Phakiso Booysen:
SmartStart has shifted mindsets. The children benefiting from this work are the leaders of tomorrow. The full impact is monumental and will become even clearer in the next 10–20 years.

0:23 - Tracy Fortune
I have not been outside. I'm sitting in an air-conditioned That is good. I'm boiling.

0:35 - vule Tshvhs
I'm so hot right now. I am boiling. I can't stand it. I was happy with the rain that we were getting, the cooler temperatures. I didn't introduce myself. My name is Vu Rezani.

0:55 - Unidentified Speaker
Just turn this to the gate.

0:57 - Unidentified Speaker
Very good.

1:02 - vule Tshvhs
Very good. I am working with Auziera. We were commissioned to write the 10-year anniversary Report for Smart Start. So you are one of the people who has been selected for us to Interview. And if you're comfortable with having your camera on, it's fine. If you're not comfortable with it, you can...

1:37 - Tracy Fortune
If I have problems with connectivity, I'll put it off.

1:44 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, okay. So you are one of the people who are chosen that we can have a conversation about the work that Franchisor for Smart Start. I have a couple of questions that I'm going to ask you. Please feel free to answer to your heart's content. Share as much as you can. And be open. Nothing is right. Nothing is wrong. It's going to benefit everyone at the end of the day. Hopefully, it benefits everyone at the end of the day. So, to start off, can you just give me... I'm going to turn to my screen because I have a screen on this side. And I'm also going to be recording the Interview. I'm going to be recording for writing purposes. And if you're also recording on your side, it's fine. It's not a, it's not a train smash. So I wanted to say that, can you just give me like a bit of background on the work that you do?

3:09 - Tracy Fortune
On Auro's work. So we are, I suppose we, We run three programs. We're an ECD organization. We run programs that support the full age cohort for young children from zero to six. So we have a home-based program. It covers zero to six. Our biggest cohort in that program, though, is zero to two, which does not get a lot of support. But we find that in rural communities, there are also large numbers of children that are not in school. So we don't exclude them from this program. So in the Northwest, where the program is run, 25% of our children are between three and six in this program. Then we have a three to five year program, which is the Smart Start program as a franchisee. And lastly, our center support program, where we support ECD centers with the full spectrum of support services, from governance, financial management, training, to infrastructure and registration. And then underpinning all of that in each of those programs, the practitioners are trained trained in a learning program to implement sort of as an LP. And we do offer accredited training as well in QCTL level four, as well as skills course. So we've been around for right now, 48 years. And we've done lots of research advocacy, and we have currently, I'd say about 1,100 field workers, and about 60 staff at head office. Well, across the different provinces, about 60 staff members.

5:37 - vule Tshvhs
So I think what I, okay, thank you for the background. So one of my first questions, core questions is, can you take me back to when you first became a Smartstart Franchisor? What was happening in your context at the time and what made you decide to join?

6:01 - Tracy Fortune
So I think when we first became a Smart Start franchise, it was roundabout, I mean, I'd say 2015, we started 2016 with Smart Start. Our context was that we were rolling out our home-based program. We had redesigned the program to specifically focus on the first 1,000 days. And so we needed something for the three to five-year-olds. We then did develop something of our own. But when Smartstart started with theirs, we actually just jumped at the opportunity to take that on board, because it came with a whole infrastructure and system aligned to it. And so we we actually thought that that would work better for us than our own existing Playgroup program that we had started to roll out round about the same time almost. So that's sort of the context for us in terms of where we came on board. We didn't participate in the development of the Smart Start program because we didn't have our own Playgroup We had an FCM home-based program. But we were on board almost immediately afterwards as one of the key partners. Sorry, are you there?

7:41 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, I'm here. I'm here.

7:43 - vule Tshvhs
I've just lost my screen.

7:44 - Tracy Fortune
So I can't see.

7:46 - Tracy Fortune
I'm here. I'm listening. I can't see.

7:56 - vule Tshvhs
If you're having connectivity issues, you can turn off your camera, it's okay.

8:02 - Tracy Fortune
Yeah, so yes, that's sort of our... I don't know if you want any other details in that regard.

8:10 - vule Tshvhs
And did you have any other alternatives that you wanted to consider at the time?

8:20 - Tracy Fortune
No, there were not. We were just looking at our own playgroup program. It was a year or two around about the same time Smart Start started developing theirs, we were also looking at developing ours because we thought it was a gap, it was absolutely a gap for us and while in the ECD sector but in our programs because we'd shifted the focus of our home-based program.

8:47 - vule Tshvhs
Okay and did you have any concerns at the time?

8:52 - Tracy Fortune
I think we, the concerns are more in terms of how the partnership would evolve, how things would work out. Would we be overtaken by smart start? What would happen to our own brand? Um, sort of things like that.

9:10 - vule Tshvhs
Makes sense. And, um, what were the first six to months like in practice?

9:19 - Tracy Fortune
So I think the first six to was 12 very much a learning for us because it was a new program. It was adjusting to the way, you know, the setup and the structure of the program, implementing it in that regard. We had incredible challenges for us. I remember when we started because we needed to introduce the program in to the chosen community that we were working in. And it was also new to South Africa, I suppose. And so it wasn't met with enthusiasm. In fact, it was met with resistance. And so we had to do a lot of meetings, and negotiations, and smoothing out things, and giving them a better understanding of what. So the resistance was very much from the ECD forums, who are sort of the principals in charge of the ECD centers. And so they were concerned that this program Hi, Tracy. Hi, can you hear me? Sorry, I'm not sure what happened.

12:35 - vule Tshvhs
I think you got cut off, you got cut off.

12:37 - vule Tshvhs
I'm not sure where we got cut off.

12:42 - vule Tshvhs
I think we were talking about... Challenges.

12:48 - Tracy Fortune
Yes, challenges. It wasn't smooth entry into the program. We had incredible resistance in the community that we chose to start our program with. And it was the first in the country, so nobody had heard of it before. And our centers, ECD centers in particular, were really threatened by this program and refused to allow us entry into the community. It took about three months of negotiation, of talking, of relationship building, before they finally relented. Entered and said we could start with the program. So I think we learned quite a bit from that in terms of community entry. I mean, we'd been used to community entry before, never encountered resistance. So we learned very quickly how to navigate it better in the future. So that was the sort of hiccups in that first year in terms of entry.

14:02 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, so gaining entry is what maybe made it harder or what you didn't expect? And what else? Can you describe a moment when you realized this work was making a real difference for children, practitioners, or communities?

14:24 - Tracy Fortune
I think it was losing to the, I'd say, it was off the that probably because in our first year, we actually started off with 85 playgroups in our first year, 2016. We had 85 playgroups, 500 children. So moving from there in second, third year, you started getting feedback from the practitioners and from parents what the benefits were and how it started and change their lives. And then also, as it grew, the amount of women that now became employed or working within these communities, and they became a network, a support network for a community. It was bigger than just an ECD program, an early learning program. It was a lot more than that, and it built women's confidence their self-esteem, their skills, and also the community development aspect of that, you know, you began to see also very quickly to start off with. It's just, yeah.

15:48 - vule Tshvhs
And as much that describes franchises as leaders who help shape platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how Smartstart works today?

16:05 - Tracy Fortune
Did we influence how Smartstart works today?

16:08 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah, like in what way maybe you could have contributed in how it works today?

16:12 - Tracy Fortune
I don't know. I think for us the challenges also, it wasn't smooth sailing for us, for our own Smartstart. I think with any relationship, it's never smooth sailing. So I think the challenges in terms of the things like costing, we very, off the bat, there wasn't activity-based costing and we needed to get that more simplified and get consensus around how to cost and what to cost for. I think we did have numerous conversations with Smart Start in that regard. I'm hoping that that would have helped shape the way in which they approach costing as well and the thinking. And I think also strategically, we have been able to offer a lot of support or insights from our experience as well, and contributes to, I think, the new direction that Smart Start is embarking on in terms of scale.

17:31 - vule Tshvhs
And you mentioned it being a challenge for you guys to enter into those communities that you face challenges. We have questions specifically for that. Much of Smart Start's reach came from franchises opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities? How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities? Who did you have to convince?

18:04 - Tracy Fortune
So as I was saying before, we've not, very seldom encountered resistance in the past. We've been around for 50 years. So we sort of thought we had community entry down pat but I believe here we began to encounter and so what we did initially was we stuck to the communities we were working in where we were known and trusted already and that facilitated things and made it more smooth. Traditionally, we'd also firstly engage with leadership in the community, so your councillors, your street chiefs where necessary. And very often the entry then becomes a lot easier. But one of the things we learned was that it was the forums that were the gatekeepers, the ECD forums. And so we started beginning from the outset, beginning to establish relationships with the ECD forums in communities. And that made it a lot easier. I mean, in the first one we did, we actually entered into an MOU on the basis of how we'd engage in that community. We contracted in terms of the community entry process and agreed that there wouldn't be any children coming to our programs, that we wouldn't compete, those things. So outside of that, it was all okay, um, you know, we, we just learned who to speak to first and who the more critical players were in the community then.

19:52 - vule Tshvhs
And, um, regarding practitioners, um, especially the ones that you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally and or personally?

20:07 - Tracy Fortune
So I think this is actually, I don't know if your questions are coming later, but we've, so maybe let me just start with the cohort that we started with. We practitioners do not have a qualification. It requires a lot more handholding and support. And interventions, you know, on the face-to-face and mentoring, and it requires a lot more. Whereas if practitioners have qualifications, they are able to just transition more smoothly into the running of the program and they require less handling and support. So I think that we're finding that the ones that didn't have where we, over time, with the right support, they did grow and move into running more, some of them sustainable, a lot of them would actually even evolve into a center. So there is that professional evolution, big challenge for many of our, you know, there was also a host, a large cohort that weren't qualified. I think what we've done now with recruiting is we've begun to look at more qualified practitioners, it's a challenge to find that because there's not necessarily the remuneration that comes with it and nobody with a qualification wants to come and work at that. So our play group, many of them actually stay the course even when they lose stipends, some of them evolve into charging fees, and running the centers and surviving in that way. But I think just professionally, they do grow.

22:06 - vule Tshvhs
And regarding maybe more children and families, do you have a story of a child or family that captures why this matters?

22:25 - Tracy Fortune
I think there's a Let me just, off the bat, there's a lot of stories, but I mean, so the one or two, the one that I have was in, I mean, and it actually happens across a few communities where children that go from Smart Start playgroups into schools. We can't get a lot of feedback from the schools. You know, I'm personally asking, where do they come from What center they were? And then they understand that from Smart Start and they they are very, very impressed with the development. They find, because the Smart Start playgroups are smaller, they get more attention, and the kids are actually a bit more ahead, is what we see in some of the communities. And then just, we have stories from, you know, parents in terms of how they've begun to value ECD, the changes they've seen in their children over time. Some, like, couldn't speak to start properly start of work and now they were more confident and learning things. And practitioners talk of their own experience and growth and how they've evolved as well.

23:45 - vule Tshvhs
Also, maybe now we turn it back to you as a What is the hardest part of being a Franchisor that people outside of Smart Start often don't see or understand?

24:00 - Tracy Fortune
I think that, you know, it's the, the challenges evolve over time. So you need to resolve something and then there's always new different challenges. So I think for us, it was, from our Perspective, it was internal Perspective is being, having our own systems connect and correlate with smart starts. So we had a lot to do in terms of, it helped us grow as well in the sense of proving our internal systems, improving our project management, improving our financial management because we did have hiccups, we were performing as fantastically and so over time, we've we began to understand what to do, how to improve, what interventions. So that was critical. Our management systems and processes improved and grew. Those were challenges we had internally. We understood that management is a critical function of succeeding and you've got to have a strong management system in place. You've got to have strong project managers and we that's played a vital role, our growth in that regard. We also feel that because of our systems that have evolved to the extent that now we are very capable of scale and then I think activity-based costing that is hard because we are able to see the gaps will be underfunded and I think that remains the biggest challenge for us in the areas where we have to subsidize the program which plays on our resources across the organization. Financially, human resources, et cetera.

25:50 - vule Tshvhs
Just to jump in there, what support, I hear you mentioning finances, what support is still missing?

25:58 - Tracy Fortune
So it's actually just more financial in terms of covering all the costs. So it's not fully covered. So we don't really, I mean, we've got our own systems, we've got our own financial management processes. We don't necessarily need support with that. We just maybe find that our finance office is not fully funded in the program or our income is not costed. I don't get a fee for being in there. It's only a programmatic cost, which is not sufficient to cover all the expenses that we have. So that's a challenge. That remains our biggest challenge.

26:40 - vule Tshvhs
And regarding learning over time, right? What have you learned over the past about 10 early learning, communities, leadership, and yourself? I know we mentioned entry into communities was a challenge. You spoke about management, how you had to incorporate systems that worked to ensure that your program has the ability to scale, upscale. Learned about yourself? What have you learned in the past 10 about community, leadership, and yourself?

27:15 - Tracy Fortune
So I think communities, I think I've covered that in terms of what the challenges were that we've experienced. One of the other things we've learned was that retention. Two critical elements or enablers of the program of the stipends and nutrition. And so we found that there's a high attrition of practitioners if there are no stipends or a high attrition of children where there's no nutrition. So that is a big key for us because we lose and our numbers are reduced where that's not in place. And then I think the third one is that the model needs to like be flexible and adaptable so you can't go to the rigid sense of your playgroup and it was going to be a playgroup and we found that many of our practitioners are quite entrepreneurial so growth is the natural next step and many of them have grown quite bigger and so your support needs to almost evolve into that kind of growth, and you've got to be more fluid in what you put out there. And then I think at the same time, when we begin achieving the results or the outcomes we do, we understand that sometimes even though practitioners don't have qualifications, they can still achieve the child outcomes. So, what are improve the quality of the teaching and the quality of the learning, the interactions, then that becomes critical for us. So it's what elements to strengthen, despite your environment that you find yourself in, and to work with what you have. You work to what the community there is, and not set impossible barriers so often So you must have a qualification rather than work with those who don't necessarily have, but give them the support necessary to actually make it. And leadership is key for success. The ones that are shown that succeed or grow are where they are strong. They're strong leaders. They are entrepreneurial, they lead the program. That's both from the franchisee Perspective and from our Perspective as an organization, because in communities where we have strong managers, we really do exceptionally well. We provide less support operationally in those areas. So in the Northwest, we are in the West Coast, we are in the Northern Cape. And so our managers run it and they hold it and they are able to just implement well and we can reach the score. So your management and leadership, strong management and leadership is essential to the success. It's not just about the, yes, our practitioners are key, they're critical, but they need support, they need structure, they need a framework and a good leadership to make sure that it runs smoothly and it works well. So they all interrelated, all fundamental part of the process.

31:05 - Unidentified Speaker
And about yourself?

31:07 - Tracy Fortune
I think that, you know, I suppose resilience is that one has to have resilience, that you've got to be flexible and not almost fix on an outcome or on a result and not try to push an agenda too much in terms of where you want things to go. And I think just to be open to the process mean a lot of the time is to be open. And I think what I've learned from doing that is that I'm able to see a lot more things than not just going into something with Microsoft perceived notion of what must be but being open to everything else influencing that and I think it's reaching because you come to something completely different from where you start with and be able to shape things in a much better way that is firstly consensual because everybody else has contributed as well but that also is contextual and that is able to really solve the problem that you see speaking to and it's diverse and not just one-dimensional. So I like the openness, the fluidity of all of that process.

32:31 - vule Tshvhs
And looking back in the, over the decade, right. What makes you most proud about your role in Smart Start?

32:46 - Tracy Fortune
I'd say it's the growth. I think the growth, both in terms of numbers, absolutely. But I think that we've grown, like we started off with 85 franchisors, we now have 1,008. And I think 500 children, they're now over 9,000. So there's been some really great growth in that regard. But the growth has not just been numbers, it's been organizationally, it's been systems, it has been through our M&E, like quite multidimensional in terms of the last 10 years and what we've learned to be able to apply across the organization and just grow in terms of our own work. And I think that What I like as well is that we're not insular either. It's just not focused on what Aldo is doing, but we get a very broad overview of the sector as a whole through our partners, through the network, and your contribution in the bigger landscape. You can see that a lot more clearly, and that we're all working towards an end goal. And you can measure that. You can see it actually happening. It's tangible. So I think that really is what I'd say is good. It's been measurable. It's been visible. It's tangible. Rather than say, oh, my goodness, what have we achieved in the last? We're actually able to pull it out and give you the numbers and give you that. Put all of that down.

34:40 - vule Tshvhs
And looking ahead and as Smart Start looks forward to the next decade, what do you think franchises will need in order to succeed at an even greater scale?

34:55 - Tracy Fortune
So I think that we're almost on the path already in terms of what franchises franchisors will need, and smart starts beginning to open up the path. They are looking to decentralize and empower franchisors to run more independently of the central hub, which I think is a positive step in the right direction. So firstly, the decentralization is good, and then that's needed for that. I think it's also, you know, the tension that is going to be with giving the independence, if you like, And I think that letting go is what's necessary and allowing franchisors to almost evolve into their own in establishing that. But I think at the same time, there has to be a connection. It's not just independent and there you off on your own and into the sunset. So it's that interdependence and I think that relationship needs to be designed. It needs to be designed, carefully curated and come from both sides. So that's going to be a learning experience because there's probably going to be push and pull from both angles. So it definitely needs facilitating curated design of the future and I think that sort of the open communication and support is a critical part of the process and it's just, you know, to be open, really to be open to what is possible, to understand I think this goes both ways to understand or appreciate that we want the same thing, we may want it in different or do it different ways but ultimately our end result, our goal is for the same thing and so how do we best support each other in getting there but in the process we also need to accept that we're going to think differently. How do we navigate the differences So we don't anticipate that. I think what stands us in good stead is that each partner is willing to put in what's necessary for the end result and they will not be almost tied down by their own expectations if you see that it's for the greater good you're more willing to accommodate that than being fixed on how you need to have this role, how you must do this, how you must do that. And so I think it's going to require an openness, a willingness to change, flexibility, and willingness to adapt to what we understand and know, be the best way forward.

38:24 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, now we have reached our final question. If you could say one thing to South Africa about what Smart Start has achieved, what would it be?

38:39 - Tracy Fortune
Can I say a few things and you can just pick? So I think for me, what I've seen is that Smart Start shows what's possible when like-minded people come together. And so within a space of 10 they have achieved a phenomenal, it's been a phenomenal achievement. Firstly, in terms of the numbers, yes, we haven't reached the million that we hoped to reach, but we actually have learned so much During the period, we've adapted, we've grown, we've adjusted. And so we, as a network, we've built entrepreneurial spirit. There's been skills development. There's thousands, 13,000 playgroups at the moment. And the scale, the scale on its own is incredible in terms of what has been achieved, not just that the learning, it almost becomes a blueprint for others to do the same and it's not just local, it's actually beneficial internationally. So we've been able to learn programmatically what to do, how to adapt from our M&E, from our systems Perspective. So the learning, the growth and the value are actually exponential and I don't think we can almost limit it to the that's the one thing, it's huge, it's just so phenomenally big and within the ECT space, it is just you know a beacon and an example not just for ECT I think but in the sector and the space, it's showing what really is possible over a limited time period in fact. So yeah, I think that what I feel has been its value in the ECD landscape, it's actually fundamentally shifted so many things for ECD in South Africa, policy-wise, financially, programmatically, child outcomes, practitioner outcomes, learning agenda, knowledge generation, all of those things have been incredibly valuable.

41:10 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you so much for your time. Your Perspective is deeply valuable. And I think you shared so much and you shared a lot to so many of maybe the missing questions. Hi, can you still hear me? I just broke up for a minute. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, you've shared in great detail. Um, but now, um, I just wanted to ask you if it's okay while we are writing and we want to quote maybe some of the things that you've said, if it's okay, we just use your name, not just that name, just saying this person shared this part about being a Franchisor or maybe your photo, if we have it.

42:04 - Tracy Fortune
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I mean, it's a huge celebration. It's big, it's a milestone. And so, yeah, absolutely. I'd love to celebrate it with you.

42:13 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. And thank you for the work that you do. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day.

0:39 - vule Tshvhs
Hello, good afternoon. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

1:00 - Unidentified Speaker
How are you?

1:02 - vule Tshvhs
I'm good.

1:03 - vule Tshvhs
I'm good. I thought you could not hear me.

1:06 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Yes, I couldn't hear you, but I saw that I was having a problem with my speaker, but I managed to fix it.

1:14 - vule Tshvhs
OK, no problem. My name is Vuledzani. We are helping Smartstart write its 10-Year Report. So we are interested in your experiences, told in your own words, what it took to make this work, what changed along the way, and what you've learned. There are no right or wrong answers. Everything we share helps us tell the Smart Start story. So when I look up, I'm looking at my other screen. I'm just looking at my screen. So feel free to answer as much as you can. If your network is disturbed because of the camera, it's OK. If you want to turn it off, it's OK. But share as much as you can, OK?

2:07 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Yo, wow. Where to start? And I just hope I'll be able to share as much as I can.

2:17 - vule Tshvhs
I don't know.

2:21 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Can you hear me properly? Yes, I've lost you for a second there. I don't know if it's my network.

2:31 - Unidentified Speaker
I have to turn off my camera because of the network.

2:33 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
But I wanted to let you know. Yes, I think so.

2:37 - vule Tshvhs
OK, let me turn off my camera then. But I just wanted to let you know that the meeting is being recorded for Report writing purposes. You can also turn off your camera. The first question that I'd like to ask you is that, can you please take me back to when you first became a Smart Start Franchisor? What was happening? In your context at the time, and what made you decide to join?

3:19 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Yo, what a big and difficult question, but I'll try to answer it.

3:25 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, let's go.

3:27 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
It's because I took over from somebody. Lesedi  was established by Christine Wilde in 1993, then she decided to go for retirement in 2023. That's when I took over from her. But fortunately enough, when Smartstart came to Lesedi to establish a partnership, I was already working for Lesedi. I started working at Lesedi in 2012 as an ECG trainer. And then in 2017, we started engaging with Smartstart about the partnership and the work that they want us to do together as partners. I have few things that I will share during that time, but I hope that will be enough for you to be able to do the Report. But what I can tell you is that Lesedi have the same model, almost the same model as Smartstart where we are working in informal settlement and isolated areas, but we are using the mobile unit vans where we are going there where there's no access to ECT, where children don't have access to ECT due to the difficult circumstances in living a lifestyle. So, when Smartstart came to Lesedi to establish a partnership, to us it was embracing the work that we were already doing as Lesedi, as an organisation. So, it was edging on what we were already doing as an organisation. It was a good thing and it was a very good initiative to expand and to show people that really this thing can work. It's not about the building. It's not about the ECG centres. Children can learn everywhere with everyone. So that's when we were trying to bridge along the way with our own models. So what I can tell you, our partnership with Smart Start started in 2017. And then we started signing our agreement. In 2018, when we started having our first coach, when we started this program. And it was a very, very interesting thing. But what we have done, as you say, as a Franchisor, we wanted to pilot the whole idea. It was already we have the same model, but in a different way. We are using the same curriculum, but we wanted to check if we do this in a different way. We started approaching ECD patrons, we started approaching ECD forums, ECD congress, just to find out how are they going to buy into the idea, buy into this new initiative within their own communities. And it was a good thing because we started asking them, let's start with the ECG Smart Start Classroom model. So where we are going to have a Smart Start Classroom within the ECG centre premises, which was a good thing because what we did, we took people that were ECG practitioners, trained with ECG Level 4, and then also trained with the Community Development Level 4 qualifications. So we wanted them to start new things within their own ECG So this Smart Start model, when it came to them, it was a new lift for them to start new projects in their ECD centres. So it went very, very well. But in 2018, that is when we started having more intensive conversations, more intensive discussions around other models with Smart Start and other franchisors. Started introducing the day mother model and also the play group model. But to our surprise, it was very, very difficult as a Franchisor because now people were getting used to that model of ECD classroom. It was also easy for ECD centers to adopt some of the kids from the street, from the community who were not having access to come and attend ECD centers and then make sure that the age cohort that this master is targeting is also part of the EC descent. But what I can tell you that it was a very, very exciting and difficult journey, but at the end of the day, we were able to have this strengthen our partnership with the other stakeholders to make sure that this partnership of Smart Start and Estadi is a solid partnership. That's when Estadi started introducing the Smart Start model. Because when we started, we started targeting the communities of Blue Fountain and Buthaben. But after our engagements and with other communities, that's when we started expanding to other three-state areas that are near our operations area. I don't know if we have questions before I can continue.

8:56 - vule Tshvhs
No, no, no. I wanted to know, did you have any concerns?

9:00 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Yes, we do. We do. We do. We did have our own concerns, because our concerns are, because remember what I said, we started to, the program introducing the Smartstart model to the community, to the ECD centres with the ECD Smartstart classroom. But now, In 2019, that's when we started introducing other models so that people can understand there are other models that we can be able to maximize the access to those kids. It's not only ECD centre. Some of the ECDs are too far from those communities. So there should be other ways to make sure that we maximize the access, which is other models that SMARTARCH came about, shared with us to say, have different models that you can introduce to the different communities depending on the needs of those communities. So the concept that we had was when we introduced the day mother model, that's when people, you know, when you do the training, you have about 50, 70 people attending the training. But as time goes on, when people are now starting to starting to do the program. That's when some of them, they feel like, no, actually, I'm in the wrong sector or I'm in the wrong profession or whatever, whatever reason. Some of them, because of our unemployment rate, they were expecting to get some reinvestment, not even reinvestment, they want to give them interest or something. So we started introducing a 500 grant stipend, we smashed that. But to others, the 500 grant was not enough. So we ended up losing people bit by bit, especially with the day murder model. But also, what was also concerning about us, about the whole thing, that when we checked the areas that Lesedi was operating, because as you know, I don't know if you know that Lesedi's We don't have any other franchises. So we don't have any partners that are working with us with the Smart Start model. So that's when this thing of saturation of ECD centres starting to affect our models, including even our own ECG mobile unit models. Because now, ECG centres started to mushrooming. Now, there is an ECG centres here, next door. Now, it's also smart start here. There is a lot of competitions. And also, even within those formation that we started with when we started with partnership this program to them. They started having their own issues. Some of them, they got dissolved. Some of them started in new constitutions. That's when they started acting as if now their model is a competition to them. But what we did, we started engaging with the DBE, which is the Department of Basic Education, when they started absorbing in the ECD sector to their own portfolio. So that's when we introduced the whole thing. This is not about competition. This is about making sure that each and every child and adult have access to the ECD. And we also have to make sure that we deliver a quality program that is recognized. Because we cannot just say, I'm doing ECD, but when we check the curriculum, we don't even know about that curriculum. So that was the good part of our partnership with SMARTs that was already using a recognized curriculum and also SMARTs is using the recognized and so these two curriculums were complementing each other. We are doing the same thing even though the programs were like SMARTs program and other programs but did your way to stay.

13:37 - vule Tshvhs
And what were the first, let's say, six to 12 months like in practice? What turned out to be harder than you expected and what surprised you?

13:50 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
No, we're doing the first when we started the partnership. Things were much easier as I said to you when we started this partnership we targeted the ECD centres to have a smart start classroom at ECD centres. But because ECD was already in this sector and we are also a RTO, a resource and training organisation, so we were training those people with ECD qualification. So it was easy for us to attract them to come and be part of the programme. But when we started exploring other models, models like their mother models, a playgroup model. That's when things became more difficult because now people started, we were targeting those unemployed mothers, those unemployed youth to start doing something in the community, which is a good initiative of Smart Start, making sure that at the end of the day, we are making sure that a child is getting access to a good quality education. But now the issue was because there are mushrooming ECD centres that are not even registered. That's when we started having this in one street. We have a smart starter with two mushrooms, ECD centre, and another recognized or registered ECD centre. So it was like now we are competing. People were looking after I don't know, easy way of getting quick cash. But with Smart Start, that's when we do the training, that's when we are introducing the whole thing about the whole program. Why are we having Smart Start in the first place? Why are we introducing this new, good program to the community? So that's when some of the ECD sectors, they were keen. And what I love about it, in the first months. They were the ones who identified the smart status for us. So when we introduced a new model, the other new models, that's when things become difficult, because now they are no longer linked to the ECE centres. We are introducing the program to everyone who is interested, everyone who wants to start any good initiative within the community they live in. So some of the ECE centres, they started being Italian. They started being, I don't know, hostile, thinking that this is a competition. But after we included the DBE people, that's when things have become more and more easier for everyone. Even now, as we speak, we are now working with the DBE in Free State. I'll actually focus on the Department of Education in Free State, where we are now targeting the children in in the farms, and then what do we have introduced to them, we said now, they said it was the only Franchisor in a free state, and we can't go everywhere because of the resources. Why can't we introduce other stakeholders, other NGOs who are in the same sector, who are willing to work with us to maximize the access to those areas that they are operating at, even the farms. So now we are starting to have those intensive engagements. So I think in the next financial Year, we'll be talking about a different language.

17:37 - vule Tshvhs
So I have maybe eight questions, if I'm not mistaken. So right now we're on the third one and we are on a time So can you just please try and give detail but not... We need to keep it to the time that we have. So in seeing impact, can you describe a moment when you realized this work was making a real difference in children, practitioners or communities?

18:15 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Since I took over, in 2023 until now, I've seen a very huge difference within our communities. Because when we do our own data capturing, we've realized that we are now, since we started our partnership with Smartstart, we are now reaching more than 2,000 using the Smartstart model. In a Year. So, meaning that that 2,000 within our reach is a huge difference compared to when we are not doing anything. I don't know if I answered your question, but what I can also tell you is about the commitment that this Masada Heavy, because was last Year what I asked the team to do is for us to do our own audit just to find out how many ECG centres were established from a smart starter who started as a day mother or who started as a play coop. You can be surprised. Some of them are now even charging fees. Some of them are now having their own facilities, which is a good thing. Because there is an impact. Now they are calling themselves E3 centres, but with the Smart Start operating with the Smart Start model.

19:52 - vule Tshvhs
And on shaping the platform, Smart Start describes franchises as leaders who helped shape the platform itself. In what way did your experience influence how Smart Start works today?

20:11 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
What I can tell you is that with this platform, the resilience is the main thing, especially with our own Smart Start, Smart Start has that we started with. What I can tell you, from we started this, we are still having those ladies in the program, who are still in the part of the program, who are still here, who are still going, who have started their own ECG centres, starting as a smart starters. It shows that resilience and hard work is already changing the whole thing. Because if it wasn't for this partnership with SMART Centre and the state, and them as a franchisee, with the support that we've been giving them. I don't think we will have those people in the program. But with the support, there is a change. Even with the meetings that we've been having within the sector, within the province, they are always represented their own executive. So it shows that there is a resilience that can make a change within the platform.

21:45 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, and much of Smart Starts reach came from franchises opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?

21:58 - vule Tshvhs
Who did you ask for convince and what mattered most?

22:03 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
It's a good question. When the study started introducing this non-centre based programmes, we normally use our ECT matrons as our gatekeepers. And then they will be the ones to show us or introduce other stakeholders to us. What I can tell you about the whole thing is that the ECD matrons are the gatekeepers. They are the ones that can open our own doors because they have their own formations, which is ECD forums. They have their own representatives that are even within intersectoral committees within the provinces in the Department of Education. So using them as our gatekeepers, using them as our resources to make sure that we get all other stakeholders in one table. I will say that the ECD matrons are the main gatekeepers for us to be able to expand or to be known or for people to know about us as the organizations or whatever programs or initiatives that you want to start within the ECD sector. The ECD matrons are there good and they go to people that you can use to get where you want to go in the UC sector.

23:35 - vule Tshvhs
Okay and touching again on practitioners, thinking about the practitioners you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally and personally? I know you highlighted a bit in some of the questions, but can you be more specific? Is there a specific story that you'd like to share with us of someone you saw change over time professionally and personally?

24:06 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Thank you so much. There is one case study that I would like to share with you. There was one lady who started with us franchisee as a non-centre based with the playbook. And then the lady, the way she loved the program, the way she was dedicated, she started asking about what courses that she needs to do in order for her to change her life professionally and personally. So she started attending our ECD training as I told you, that was the RTO. And then she obtained her qualification, level four qualification. And she continues studying with Motheo TVET College, which is the Tibet College in Blue Fountain, to do her diploma in Educare, which is what she did. She's now studying education. But what I can tell you, she started with only six children. And now, she's having an ECG centre of 34 children, and they're paying fees from 510 to 800. And she started with nothing. She's now getting a lunchbox, fully steady, for her to be able to give those kids porridge in the morning when they arrive. So that is one of the people who seem to be in my mind always when I wanted to motivate other franchises to say to them, you can make it. No matter how long it's going to take, but you can make it. Because now what I can tell you, she has registered her city center is now on a silver, is registered with silver. She's now able to, she was, actually she was able to apply for subsidy, I'm not sure that it was they haven't done with their own internal processes to tell us who applied, among those who applied, who qualified. So I just hope that she's also qualified to be subsidised with the DBE. But I can tell you that the lady is one of those ladies that can stand here and what she has done now, she took all the ECD practitioners that are working with the tool ECD training for them to obtain level four ECD qualification.

26:50 - vule Tshvhs
All right. And we've touched on practitioners. Now I want to touch on children and families. Can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?

27:01 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
I don't know where to start. But what I can tell you, there is one child that started at one of the ECG centers when we started this program. It was in the ECG classroom, his master classroom. And the parents were a little bit concerned about the child's performance because now they thought that the child had has some kind of disability, which is speech delay. Only to find out it's because of delayed stimulation was the one who caused the child to have a delay in speech. So when we started introducing this child to the program, because they couldn't afford to pay ECG center fees, so we introduced the ECG master classroom where they were going. And already the child was close to five years, and then she only had one Year of ECG exposure for her to go to the great app. What I can tell you, the child is flourishing in school. You'll never say that the child had a speech therapy, no speech delay. It was because of late stimulation. That child didn't have any disability. It was only for late stimulation. Late stimulation. So after introducing the program, after she attended the full day ECG classroom of Smart Start, that child was performing very well. She can speak very well. She's performing well in school. She's now in grade five.

28:52 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, that's good. OK, then we are taking it back to franchises. Is the hardest part of being a Franchisor that people outside of Smart Start often don't see or understand?

29:10 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
What I can tell you, my dear, is when you introduce any program with me, even if it's not a Smart Start program, when you introduce anything that's some sort of project or a program, people are expecting something to be paid for. Because when you We even need to adjust this master programme. When we started doing the training, people will ask, when we do recruitment, they will ask, are we going to get something out of this? Besides the certificate or besides whatever, are we going to get paid? That's the hardest part of every franchise, or even to keep the retention rate very high, because when there's no staffing, people are demotivated. So they start focusing on other things, or they start losing interest, because they're not getting anything from this. So that's the hardest part of us as a franchise, of keeping the retention rate, especially of the day mothers, if there's no starpent.

30:18 - Unidentified Speaker
And what support is still missing?

30:22 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
For them? What I don't understand is that our franchises are going through all these trainings. One of them is the business case training, where we are introducing those trainings to how to sustain their own businesses. Because when they start involving themselves in the problem, they know that this is a business model. One has to start sustaining themselves. They can't depend on us forever. But now, as time goes on, because of the life that we are living in, and especially the targeted communities that we study is targeting, that's when we saw that this high rate of unemployment is causing these people to lose interest because they are expecting something. Even now, one can start being a smart starter. Tomorrow, if the people are coming, there's EPW2P program, people must come in. And register themselves so that they can get appointed, even if it's a two-month or a three-month project. People are leaving the program because they're not getting anything. They'll go and join that three-month program, and they want to come back after that. Because after that, when the program ends, they have to come back and start all over again. So those are the challenges that we are facing as a franchise. To retaining people within the program without any incentive is a problem. But what we have done is that we were trying to ease up some of the things to say, OK, guys, we know you're complaining about nutrition. You know you're complaining about parents not giving you any support when it comes to fees and everything. Actually, Smart Start is giving people all the resources that they need. OK, whatever, teaching aids, everything, they do get that. And then the good part of it, as a Franchisor, as you said, we also involved them, included them with our own program of lunchbox, with the partnership of lunchbox, for them to get food from lunchbox. Some of them are getting only porridge, some of them are getting the whole month, what you call, whole month quarterly for them to be able to at least give children something to eat while they are at the program. So we are now even starting to have more engagement with Hope Worldwide, because they wanted to check all small starters that are in our program, so whether they are affiliated with them, so that they can also assist them with a mouthful of food, so that they can start giving. Some of the kids, they can't learn without eating. So we are like, let's try to give them some support, some sort of support, even if it's not finances. And then we can start from there. Some of them, they do get, some of them, they don't get.

33:34 - vule Tshvhs
And now to reflect back on learning over time, what have you learned over years about early learning, communities, leadership, or yourself?

33:50 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Can I start with you said early learning?

33:53 - vule Tshvhs
Yes, what have you learned over the past about early 10 learning, communities, leadership, or yourself?

34:06 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Okay, I will start with ECDLE learning. To be honest with you, this is a very good foundation for our kids in education. You know why I'm saying this? When we were reflecting back as the three-state Department of Education and other partners like us, other stakeholders like us, we're like for us to be able to get the results that we are getting in the metric is because of good solid foundation in ECD. So what I can tell you is that if our kids are getting access to ECD or the early interventions or early stimulation as early as possible, we'll have a good result at the end of the And also, with any learning, you can't do it alone. We have to have other people to work with you, even if they're not in the same sector, but it can be someone from health, it can be someone from a PwP, it can be someone from municipality. If all these stakeholders are coming together, we can make sure that our kids are getting a quality education until they finish their high school. And we can maintain that within those years of learning, that those kids are not dropouts, we are making sure that we are reducing the numbers of dropouts. Because if we have a solid foundation, I don't think you're going to lose your interest in school. And then when it comes to communities, what I can tell you, our communities are different. You cannot apply the same blanket with community A to community B. What you need to do is to make sure that you do your own research as an organization, make sure that you know the needs of that community, then you'll be able to know the interventions that need to be done in those communities. If you're not, as I say, these communities, the rural area, they need ECDCENT, only to find out that those people who are living in that area are not working, how will they be able to for the ECG centers. That's when the program like Smart Start or ECG mobile unit comes in too easy. If it's a rural area, there is no ECG center. I must come with the ECG center. It does not work like that. We cannot compare the communities. The communities are different. We have to treat them differently. And if you want to make sure that you meet their needs, Make sure that you know the needs of each and every community, and then you start checking which intervention needs to be done in those different communities. You cannot have the same interventions for different communities. And when it comes to leadership, this one is very difficult. As I said, I started taking over from the person who established this thing, this is the organization. And then I took over for me 30 years later. You can imagine the pressure that I'm in, in that. But what I can tell you is that you lead by the example. And then you cannot, as a leader, you cannot do it alone. You have to make sure that you go along with your team to make sure that things are done properly. Things are effective. Things are in line or aligning with what is needed, whether it's policies or whatever, but make sure that you are doing this with your team.

38:02 - Unidentified Speaker
And about yourself.

38:07 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
I've grown a lot as an individual also. What I can tell you, I've grown a lot as an individual. And what I've also learned is that you learn from others. There are those people who came before us who has experience, who has knowledge, who has expertise. We need to learn from those people. We need to take it from there, from them to say, they've been here for more than 40 years, more than 50 years. What can I learn from those people? You start learning and building up your growth as individual from learning from others. So I have to learn from others as I have learned from those who have been in the sector for a very long time. I have learned from other organizations within the network of Smart Start that this can be done if we all want to go and do this together.

39:02 - Unidentified Speaker
And what have you had to unlearn?

39:07 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Change is difficult to adapt to change is difficult. Sometimes as individuals, if you are getting used to something, it's difficult for you to let go. So from what I've learned from the whole thing throughout these 10 years of this partnership or me being a leader within the organization is that sometimes I need to let go of things that are not working for me for working for organizations. So I learned to let go of things that are not working for me.

39:57 - vule Tshvhs
And when you look back over the decade, what makes you most proud of your role in Smart Start?

40:08 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
What I can tell you, Oswaga, for the past two years, we've been doing S-Mastertunite, we've been invited or we've been actually chosen to host S-Mastertunite. What I've learned, what I can say is the highlight for those events is that I've never seen so much support from other organizations like in that in those days. I've never learned that there are other organizations that are existing if it wasn't for those MasterTunite events. That's when we started making more engagements because some of them are here in next door but you don't even know these people have interest in them. But what I can tell you that you are now painting free state in purple We are painting Free State in purple. We are going to introduce more organizations, community-based organizations, to be part of this so that we maximize our purple regalia in Free State. So we are now trying to make sure it's not about being in an ECD center. That's ECD sector. That's what I've learned from Smart Start United. It's not about the NGOs. Or NPOs that are in the ECG sector. Everyone is playing a part within a child's life. Whether you are coming from health, whether you are coming from whatever, but if we come together, we can make a difference. So now we want to paint Free State in purple also.

41:59 - vule Tshvhs
And just touching back on what you just said now, we are gonna now focus like on looking ahead. As much that looks forward the next decade, what do you think franchises will need in order to succeed at even greater scale?

42:25 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Collaboration is work. Collaboration, collaboration and partnerships. Because we can't do it. As I'm saying, the challenge that we are also facing is that we are the only Franchisor in Free State. You can imagine how many towns are in Free State. And what we also realized as the Franchisor is that when we, when Smart Starts together with us, we are doing our own research, when we are doing tapestry, we've realized that the areas that have a huge number of children that don't have access to ECD are not within our reach. So in order for us to go to those towns, we have partners, we have NPOs that are working there. Why can't we start communicating with them? Why can't we collaborate with them? Why can't we partner with them to make sure that we are reaching those areas? We think through those NPOs. So that's why we are now having this conversation, having this engagement to make sure everyone is invited, not a city sector people only. Everyone who is interested is invited. So now opening up the platform for everyone who is interested.

43:37 - vule Tshvhs
And our last question. Thank you. Last question is, if you could say one thing to South Africa about what SMART that has achieved, What would it be?

43:58 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
... You know, Smart Start always ... Preaching this motto saying, no child should be left behind. So, what I'm seeing, what I can share with people that, with Smart Start network is, is possible. With the network, with the partnership, with other sectors, with partnership, with anyone who's interested to come to the board, what I can tell them is that, yes, it's possible to make sure that no child should be left behind. With us alone, we can't do it, but with others coming on board, we can do it. But what I can tell hello, this Smart Start delivery platform is a good platform. That means everyone to be intentional about it. You have to have your aim and purpose when you come to this platform delivery. Because now, Smart Start is not only focusing on only three to five-Year-olds is now focused in all kids. All children needs to have access. So let's make sure that that access is maximized with everyone who's in the community. Regardless of your background, regardless of your sector, but we need to all come together and making sure that this happens. We should not leave any child behind.

45:55 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you. Thank you so much for... I just want to turn my camera. Thank you so much for your time. We deeply, deeply value your perspective. And I just wanted to just have one last request. While we are writing, in the process of writing this Report, And we want to quote some of the things that you've said. Is it OK if we use your name, just your name only, and maybe your photo?

46:25 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Yes, of course, of course. You can do that because this is how people will know about that. If now you want to hide behind the scenes, you know even a director or a producer, when people are talking about their stories, they're not talking about the producer or director. They're talking about the characters. The people that they are seeing. So I want to be seen. I'm part of the characters, so I have to be there.

46:54 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you so much for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Thank you so much.

46:59 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Thank you so much. I just hope I was able to answer your question because I started to have anxiety. I just come from the doctor and doctor just diagnosed me that I have a high level of anxiety. So I was like, will I be able to answer the questions as my best of my ability, or do you understand that? That's why you were like, when you say, just be brief. But because of what I'm being diagnosed now, I'm like, am I doing the right thing? Am I saying good things? No, it was. And not right questions, and not wrong questions. We're just here to share our experience, which is what I did. I hope it was enough for you to know.

47:38 - Unidentified Speaker
No, it was more than enough. Thank you so much.

47:41 - Kedibone Innocentia Mosala
Thank you so much and have a lovely day ahead of you, my darling.

Hello, good afternoon.

0:35 - Unidentified Speaker
Good afternoon, Julie.

0:37 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha

0:40 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
I am well, I would say so.

0:45 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah, I got the email. I got the email. I hope you are feeling a little better.

0:52 - Unidentified Speaker
The most important thing, I'm here.

0:54 - vule Tshvhs
That's what matters. But most important, your health as well. Yeah, I'm here. Yes, yes. Thank you again for making time. As I have informed you, we are writing a Report for Smart Starts 10-Year Report and we are in your experiences, in your own words, and what it took to make this work, what changed along the way, and what you've learned. I'm reading on my screen here. If I'm looking up, please don't mind. So there are no right or wrong answers. Everything you share helps us tell the Smart Start story as you have lived it, okay? And I wanted to inform you that the meeting is being recorded for the purposes of Report writing. We are not going to share anything with other parties outside of this. Is that okay? We are going to start now. Remember just to respond with as much detail and feel free. Okay, the first question is about...

2:21 - Unidentified Speaker
You would regret?

2:25 - vule Tshvhs
You would regret? I would regret?

2:29 - Unidentified Speaker
You would regret?

2:32 - vule Tshvhs
We only have an hour because...

2:36 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
You don't say that to me. You don't say that to me.

2:41 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, let's keep it to the most important details, okay, from the questions that I'm asking.

2:52 - Unidentified Speaker
All right.

2:56 - vule Tshvhs
Regarding your joining, you joining the journey with Smart Start, take me back to when you first became a Smart Start Franchisor. What was happening in your context at the time and what made you decide to join?

3:15 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
Thank you for kind of allowing me to be part of this process. And for Smart Start, celebrating 10 years in changing lives in the country is the most fulfilling. To be part of Smart Start, changing lives for the past 10 years, it's most fulfilling. And I give it. I give gratitude to the fact that I can comfortably say I am part of that progress. Trying to answer your question one, what made me to be part? I did not have a choice. I found an organization that was already part of Smart Start. So there was no luxury of me making a decision if I want or I do not But I joined the organization in 2018. And if Smart Start is 10 years, it means we've been 10 in Smart Start, because we're amongst the organization that Smart Start started with, or that were part of cooking, you know, Smart Start, putting all the flour, the ingredients, the ingredients of making, of making up Smart Start, that that's But two, when I joined the organization, and I was in the process of understanding the broader organization, and pieces of this broader organization was Smart Start. And during that time, Smart Start came in as a, I always call the team that was falling within Smart Start to say, they behave like they are a private school Because every time you needed them in the office, they would say, smart start this, smart start that, smart start almost everywhere. And I needed then to find a way of what does smart start mean in this organization. That's for me. And how do people understand smart start? As individuals and as an organization. And I think that was the best decision. That I ever took because when I begin to understand broadly and deeply what is MatStat as a support structure in the country in bringing access and as a partner in the organization in expanding opportunities for access. And that made me to be able to find smart start within the organization within the bigger and the broader organization so that smart start is not come or does not come as a project but it comes in as a program of the organization so that so that smart start is not coming as an isolated aspect of this bigger organization but smart start comes in as part of this organization. If the organization succeed its objectives, then Smart Start is contributing to that because Smart Start is a program that we offer as an organization or that we're part of as an organization. So immediately when I got to that stage, I was able then to take my understanding and implement it to the team and transfer it to the team so that the Smart Start people are understood as part of the bigger three team. And that then, you know, started to work better. That then started for me and the organization to understand how Smart Start, in fact, is strengthening who we are as an organization.

7:20 - vule Tshvhs
And did you have any concerns?

7:26 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
When it was that isolated project, I had concerns because you think you've got a team of 152 people, inclusive of Smart Start, but when you want an organization with 152 people, there is a seven. Number that is not there because Smart Start said, the hub said there. So now what I needed to do was to take the Smart Start program and activities, align it with who we are as an organization. So that when we share resources, we share resources as an organization. And we stop thinking of Smart Start that as a funder, and because you've got a different way of treating a funder. But we see Smart Start as a partner. We see Smart Start as part of the organization. We see Smart Start as coexisting with the organization, so that we co-create as an organization. So my concerns, yes, I had concerns. I was really panicking. And I was looking at how do I close this big gap that has been created by how people understood Smart Start. And I can tell you now, it is the best experience to be part of the Smart Start. Oh, no, no, I'm not part of Smart Start, but Smart Start is part of us as a program.

9:16 - vule Tshvhs
And any realities, right? What were the first six to 12 months like in practice? What turned out to be harder than you expected and what surprised you?

9:31 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
Again, remember, when I answer that question, I would answer after the 12 months, that's been in existence, because by the time I joined, eOrganization was one Year, Smart Start was one Year, and that one Year is aligned to the time that the organization has been part. But the biggest challenges in Smart Start program was the fact that the government at that time was still struggling in understanding the aspect of Smart Start delivery, that of the non-center-based. So within government, nobody understood that because at that time, again, government people did not fully grasp the 2015 ECT policy that was speaking about other means and other aspects of the ECT workforce. Look at Chapter 10 the ECD policy of 2015, clearly defined ECD workforce. And within that, the home-based, the playgroups are included in that. But unfortunately, government employees or government officials were so into the the center-based. So it was difficult to convince them in understanding that this is another aspect that create access for those children who would not have been reached if it was not for the programs like Smart Start. So that was the first biggest challenge for me, that of how do we navigate a government to understand the importance of non-centralized based in ECD delivery. That's one. Two, it was an aspect of where you need to deploy, you know, staff members to where the children are, to where communities are. And that meant then how the program will become expensive, you know, because we as an organization and as Smart Start, we are targeting where nobody wants to go. And what does that mean? It means the most feathered areas of the country, the most rural areas of the country, where even a car at times is difficult to reach because there are children there and they need to be reached. And that then, our costing as an organization would be different from a costing from from another organization that their reach is within open areas. And that has been the biggest challenges that we're trying to kind of, I don't want to use enforce, I don't want to use that, but kind of bring attention of Smart Start. You know, that they cannot measure us with other organizations. Organizations that are urban-based, but we don't mind if they are measuring us with other organizations that are serving communities that are more marginalized and that are more rural, that there are moments where you need to leave your car and walk in terms of being able to reach the programs. That was the second. The third aspect of being a partnership with Smart Start was that when we wanted to counter the expenses by having people from those communities, it was very clear that it is difficult to find people who have the expertise that are needed for people to be conscious. So what did that mean? It mean we're using people that are coming more in the urban areas, you know, that then needs to travel to those areas. So those are the biggest challenges because that affected costing and that affected how we navigate, you know, yeah, the costing aspect of funding. Then will be coming in as the most expensive organization that then needed to match or balance with the outcomes that we are bringing into the results.

14:34 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that. And in seeing impact, can you describe a moment when you realized that this was working and making a real difference, especially for children, practitioners and communities?

14:50 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
Because we are at the centre of our attention are children. So I will start with the children. Having worked in the space of community development for the past seven years when I left government, I have been touched, my heart bleeds, you know, by the who do not have access. So the approach that Smart Start, and having said that, I want to highlight the fact that the approach that Smart Start is using is not the only, is not one and only, but it's part of approaches that kind of cater for the holistic development of a young child. That must be, It's not an alpha and omega. Yes, that's how I want to put it. It's amongst the approaches that are needed in order to bring services to the children. So the fact that we've been able to reach a number of children, you know, that could not have been reached in terms of, if there was no Smart Start program, that that's children for me, that were able to connect and align with other service providers, that where Smart Start is bringing a learning program, we tap into other existing services to bring nutrition, you know, so that you look at the holistic approach of the young adult. Two, how it has made, you know, a difference in the lives of practitioners because now practitioners are becoming entrepreneurs that are able to provide. So Smart Start has contributed, is continue to contribute in the economic aspect of the rural communities. The third one is the fact that now Smart Start is tapping into the professionalizing of the sector because that is also providing the training for at least a basic qualification for the ECT practitioners, so that when government is coming in with their requirements of a basic qualification, you know, part of Smart Start franchises are falling into the standards that the government is setting. Fourthly, for the community, the fact that communities are comfortably enough in knowing that whilst they are going out to hassle for their children, but there are services that are delivered, you know, to kind of develop their children. And that they are inclusive of them as caregivers and in making sure that they are supported in playing their role in this tripartite alliance of a child, a parent or caregiver, and a community or an early learning program, which is the key principle of how we approach the education space.

18:29 - vule Tshvhs
You briefly touched on this next question in the beginning. Now that our shift is on shaping the platform, Smart Start describes franchises as leaders who help shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how Smart Start works today?

18:51 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
that question in twofold. One, as myself, as an individual that is serving within the CEO circle of Smart Start, and what I'm bringing in that, I am bringing a lot of experiences because I worked for government for more than 25 years. And that can give you comfort to say, I am well-versed in terms of how to navigate, you know, government difficulties, government, bureaucracy, government connections. I am well-placed in terms of networking. I am well-placed in terms of advocacy. I'm well-placed in terms of understanding the ECT sector, you know, and again, I want to be upfront to say that does not mean that I am closed into learning. I learn everything. Day, having that experience. So that's the aspect that I am bringing. That is why in the Smart Start celebration, we always win, the stars of the night, we always win, you know, the best advocacy, the best social system. And that tells you, you know, my role, because the advantage of myself being the director of Dream and also serving as a CEO member of the network of Smart Start is enriched by the fact that I'm serving in many, many, many committees from provincial and at a national level. So that on its own is enriching how we shape, you know, E-Smart Start as a delivery mechanism for E-City access. That's number one. Number two, the fact that we are driven from the government policies, you know, that's one of my expertise, you know, because when I worked for government, I was working with policies, any policy that governs ECD was my responsibility within government. So that's the experience. That's the idea. That's the strength that I'm bringing into Smart Start. Then for my organization, the fact that we are able to count numbers and say, we have reached roughly 830 franchisees. As an organization. It's an indication of how we are contributing, we've been contributing into the 10 that we're celebrating today as Smart Start. The fact that we are getting, I said this before, I'll say it again, we are getting to communities where when you check when were they visited by government or by anyone else, it was many, many years ago. And the fact that we're able to tap into that, those spaces where no one wants to go, that is a kind of a reflective of how the relationship between us as an organization and Smart Start is yielding the better results for the E-City sector. The fact that we are working with Smart Start and Smart Start is better placed in terms of systems and Smart Start is a support structure to us in learning so that we can better our systems. That on its own is a kind of easy understanding that there's a mutual relationship between this partnership because that's what partnership is about. Partnership is supposed to be, you know, a give and take. What are we bringing and what are we getting in return? So there's that aligned or alignment of synergies in this partnership with SmartStart that is enabling us, you know, to be driven from a common ground, you know, so that we are, we are, we are focusing at the target and the target in this, in this, in this, in this sense is the child.

23:36 - vule Tshvhs
And, and our next question briefly touches on going into these communities. Much of Smart Start's reach came from franchises opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?

23:56 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
That's another, I'll answer that in twofold again. My responsibility as a director for the organization and my passion is making sure that in every community that we go, we do not go because we think what the community call, but we go because we are sure that this is what the community needs. So we are very intentional about stakeholder engagement. We are very intentional about deep stakeholder consultation. We are very intentional about fitting, putting ourselves in the shoes of the community that we're going to work in so that we don't come in with the attitude that we are the know-all, but we're coming in with the attitude that says we want to understand who you are and we're bringing ourselves as we are so that you can understand who we are and how we want to navigate this journey of partnership is for us as an an organization to understand that our communities, our partners, our children, our partners, our caregivers, our partners, our practitioners, our partners, how do we make sure that we are aligned in terms of the objectives that we're aiming at achieving? How do we make sure that each and every stakeholder in the process have a voice and their voices are heard? And their voices are actioned. So for me, that's the best aspect of who we are as an organization, that of taking a community with us as a partner, that of understanding that each community is unique, each community is different, and you cannot treat Indwe Edwe the way you treated Ika Opo or Nkutu, coming pure, you're coming clean, you're coming to learn, you're coming to unlearn so that you can relearn, you know, in understanding what is this community, who are they, and what do they want, and how do they want it, and what do they have to contribute in this that you are bringing.

26:30 - vule Tshvhs
And just touching again on practitioners, thinking about the practitioners you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally and personally? Do you have any specific stories like with a practitioner that you'd like to share?

26:49 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
I do not have direct stories now in my head, you know, but I can share those stories even whether in an email form, but it goes back to what I've said earlier on. That our practitioners have become entrepreneurs. And they are taking part in the economic development of the country. And as women, ECD is more women-focused. So women have different roles that they are playing in their communities, in their homes. So these women have kind of gained a confidence, they kind of gained a respect, they kind of gained the understanding of themselves as individuals and how proud they can be to contribute, not only within their household, but to the community at large. And there's nothing that fulfills an individual, like being seen, like being heard. So because of the contribution that they are making, because of the growth that they have seen, you know, tapping into as individuals, that has changed how a community respect them. Because EECD has been a space that has not been respected by most stakeholders and most people. But now, with programs like Smart Start, what were changing the mindset, were changing the narratives, how children are moving from the playgroups into the school. Because in some instances, we do get stories from schools of the children that have been moving from our playgroups into the schooling system, how they are different in terms of other children in those setups. So that on its own is an indication that, of course, practitioners differ like any other teachers. Not every practitioner who is in the ECD space is here for the sake of the child. But some are here for what is in it for me. And that is a normal life situation that not happen only in the ECT space, but those who are committed and dedicated in changing lives, you can see from their results that they are intentional and they mean business, they are about children.

29:41 - vule Tshvhs
Just ending on children, can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?

29:52 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
Ooh, vule, I need to remind myself of the stories. I do have stories, but they do not come into, you know, I do have stories.

30:02 - vule Tshvhs
You can share via email, it's okay.

30:05 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
I will, I will, I will, I will definitely, I will definitely. Because we even had an inter, if I may put it that way, you know, that we had 20, 24 years that was only focusing on how Smart Start has emerged in the KZN district. We were targeting Igbo, you know, when Smart Start started and how we've been following. And there was a research that was conducted by a doctor stroke professor from KZN that was evidence-based in showing how Smart Start has been changing the narratives.

30:54 - vule Tshvhs
And on challenges, what is the hardest part of being a Franchisor that people outside Smart Start often don't see or understand?

31:06 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
I think it's what I've mentioned earlier, the lack of government to understand the approach that is used by Smart Start. It's not an approach that a Smart Start network we slept and wake up or woke up applying it, but it's part of implementing government policies. But I must say that it's getting better by day because, again, a Smart Start, we are very strong as a Smart Start were very strong in assisting government in understanding their policies, were very strong in analysing policies, were very strong in analysing the gaps in the ECT space and the interventions that are needed thereof, were very strong in analysing the children that do not have e-access versus the children that get access. So that has helped helping a government to recognize that, in fact, we are intentional and we're very confident with the information and the activities and the plans and the implementation plans that we're bringing up front. That was the biggest challenge. The biggest challenge that we're facing as a Smart Start network again is when the other stakeholders compete with us, other stakeholders think coming into the space to take their rightful space, of which when it comes to the child, there's no one who has a right to that, as long as we're delivering services for the patient.

32:52 - vule Tshvhs
Can you still hear me? You were breaking from...

32:54 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, can you hear me now?

32:59 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
The connection issue.

33:01 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now, vule? Can you hear me now?

33:19 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, I was saying your network is cutting you. Yes, I can hear you. Yes, I can hear you.

33:26 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
OK, I was saying When was I? Oh, I was saying another biggest challenge. Yes, I can hear you. Is where other ECD stakeholders. Okay, let me also switch off my camera. Yes, so I was saying when other ECD opportunists, let me put it that way, are kind of threatening you know, threatened by Smart Start existence, you know, in the communities, because they think or they believe that Smart Start is tapping into their territories, of which, for me, I don't want to give the root word that I can use in that. There is no one who has a territory when it comes to bringing access for the young child. So they just create an issue out of nothing, because there's a lot of fish in the river. Everybody has a role to play. But because some stakeholders within the ECT space have hidden agendas. So they misdirect, they are or their non-existence, you know, into how Smart Start has taken the E-City space, that's true. But the third aspect is how Smart Start has came in and took space by storm. And that then threatens the existence of other organizations. Yeah, basically those are the three or four challenges that I can mention. Oh, I'm not sure if I've mentioned this one. Another biggest challenge that we're facing as a smart start network is when other stakeholders see us as a money, I don't want to say making, but as a moneyed organization. Service provider that when they need to satisfy their gaps, they think that Smart Start has money that can be, boom, popped out and serve their needs. And government is included in those stakeholders.

36:34 - vule Tshvhs
On learning over time, can you, just in a few words, the next questions, can you just try and make them shorter because I'm afraid we might run out of time before we get to the other answers. On learning over time, what have you learned over the past 10 years about early learning, communities, leadership, and yourself? I know you've mentioned and touched on most of this topic, But if you could just share that aspect.

37:05 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
The biggest learning is if we co-exist, we co-create, we can reach more impact. The biggest learning is what Africans always have and always say, it takes a village to raise a child. The biggest learning is to Together we can do more. The biggest learning is how we can put our heads together. And putting our heads together, we can come with the strongest solution that can solve the big problems in the country. The biggest learning is how complex ECD sector is and how we need to be thinking out of the box in dealing with complexities.

38:12 - vule Tshvhs
And when you look back over the decade, what makes you most proud of your role in Smart Start?

38:22 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
What I've mentioned earlier, how I have come openly with my uncomfortabilities, how I have become vulnerable, how I have become open to learn, unlearn, and learn, how I have become a resource in shaping the bigger smart start we are all looking at, how I am, you know, open and and transparent in how I bring about my thoughts, you know, without any reservations, because I always feel they are not about me, but they're about how we're shaping, you know, the city sector. But how I have been able, again, to give myself time to sit back, listen, breathe, and recharge, reconnect, and become a better person by learning from other members of the network. And that, for me, is the best experience that is not only building me, myself, as an individual, but it's also being transferred to my organization. How open I have become in terms of understanding that, as an organization, we can be 40 years, but there's a lot that learn from this organization that is 10 years, that is Smart Start, how we shape our existence, how we shape our growth by learning, as I've mentioned, how Smart Start is excellent in terms of systems and that we can learn from

40:10 - vule Tshvhs
And on looking ahead, as Smart Start looks forward the next decade, what do you think franchises will need in order to succeed at an even greater scale?

40:23 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
The biggest, my response on that would be what we've been always discussing with Ugris as the CEO of Smart Start. And again, I must note that it is the best experience to work with her as an open book, as a learner, you know, who always listens because there's one thing we cannot run away And it is a valid fact that there is no Smart Start without the network of organizations that forms, you know, Smart Start. And how do we then make sure that we strengthen the leadership within these organizations? Because my fear that can affect Smart Start is when we, as the senior citizens within the organization that we're serving, when we retire and we leave, You know, people who are not well oiled, who are not well nurtured, who are not well groomed to take over so that there's no break when we leave. So that for me is what I'm looking very forward into finding a succinct way of how, as a Smart Start network, we support the network of organizations in making sure that there is a sustainability. And this is what I always say to Grace. At times when she goes and as she travels the world to fundraise, she needs to help us, you know, with us in making sure that we learn the tricks of fundraising. Because the more we get into that drive, the more there's a hope for sustainability of these organizations that are forming a network and there's a confirmation and affirmation and a solid ground for Smart Start to continue for another 50 years.

42:26 - vule Tshvhs
And our last question. In your own words, if you could say one thing to South Africa about what Smart Start has achieved, what would it be? And I know one word is limiting you. The question limits what you can share with us.

42:45 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
One word is, there is impact in co-existing, in co-creating. There is impact There is impact in sense of belonging. There is impact in sense of listening. There is impact in sense of working together. That's what Smart Start has shown in this 10 years. And that's what makes Smart Start to be powerful. A sense of coexistence. Sense of co-creation, sense of belonging, sense of identity. Very important. Very, very, very important. It goes back to the previous question that you've asked. These network of organizations, they need to remain, you know, to remain themselves within the network. And how do we make sure that as a Smart Start network, we don't lose that? Because within the a smart start network, there are individual organizations that have vision and mission, but that vision and mission is aligned to what makes smart start. So how to make sure that we don't miss that.

44:18 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you so much for your time. Your perspective is deeply valued. I just wanted to request you are okay with us maybe adding adding your name to some of the comments that we made not just their name just your name just to quote you on some of the things that you've shared and maybe your photo if we have it anything anything I say here it comes from the deepest part of my heart and it is my truth and my only truth so my name can my name and surname and my picture can can be attached to that.

44:57 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
It's based on reality experiences and all that.

45:02 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Get better soon and enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you so much.

45:14 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
Thank you, my dear.

45:17 - Mmatsetshweu Ruby Shasha
Thank you for your time too.

Smartstart 10-Year Report Interview: Franchisor Perspectives
Thu, Jan 29, 2026

5:13 - vule Tshvhs
How are you? I'm good. Are you ready?

5:28 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Yeah, I was actually trying to join. It's my first time to use this app.

5:36 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, Google Meet.

5:37 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, OK.

5:38 - vule Tshvhs
I see.

5:39 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
I see.

5:40 - vule Tshvhs
No, no, no, no. It's OK. I feel like we can just start already if you are comfortable and ready.

5:48 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Yes, yes, we can start.

5:50 - vule Tshvhs
OK, my name is Vuledzani. I'm working with Auxeira. We are writing a 10-Year Report. In celebration of the people who built this work, especially franchisers. We're interested in your experience, in your own words, and what it took to make it, to make this work. So please get comfortable and get ready to share as much as you can. I have a couple of questions that I'd like to ask you. Also, just to a heads up, we are recording the meeting for the purpose of Report writing.

6:33 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
OK, no problem.

6:34 - vule Tshvhs
OK, thank you. OK, so to start off, we're going to start with joining and the journey. Take me back to when you first became a smart start Franchisor. What was happening in your context at the time? And what made you decide to join?

6:59 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
To start with, the organization that I work for is called Lima, L-I-M-A. Lima means to plou a plant. It was established in 1989. Our main focus when we started in 1989, it was agriculture. But as we were engaging with various communities, like, you know, currently we are working throughout South Africa. And as we are engaging with the various communities, then we decided to broaden our scope to do integrated community development programs and projects, but we still keep agriculture as our key focus area. So to answer your question, giving you the background information that I've shared with you, when we started, we were having a presence in Gauteng and we were doing the community works program, if I'm not mistaken, but I was not part of that group. And we were approached by Smart Start. And the person that initiated the program is no more. And she passed on. And I took over the program from her when she got sick. Yeah, but like, you know, in terms of our work as an organisation, we noticed that if we are working with children who are residing in the informal settlement, then it will complement very well with the development of the objective of the organisation. I'm not sure if I'm answering your question correctly. You are on mute, I think.

9:29 - vule Tshvhs
Sorry about that. No, no, no, you are, but I would also just like to find out, did you have any concerns with Smart Start? Yes, you said Smart Start approached you, approached the organization. So, um...

9:48 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Like, you know, just to interject, like, we wouldn't be, like, working with Smart Start even today. It was in 2016, if I could remember. And we didn't have any concerns. So, we felt that, you know, the two organizations are able to complement each other very well. So, there were no concerns. Because both organizations were at the community development space. So it was an add-on. And we felt as an organization that if we are working with Smart Start in providing the quality education to the children that are residing in Smart Start, we are going to make a positive contribution to the South African society. Yeah, so there were no concerns at all. And working with SMARTs that even today.

10:51 - vule Tshvhs
And in the early start, right? What were the first six to 12 months like in practice? What turned out to be harder than you expected? And what surprised you?

11:05 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
As I said, I was not part of the whatever but as I joined the program I can't remember when I actually joined the program um like you know what was your question again um uh it's more on the early years or the early months right from the 6th to the 12th month period what turned out to be harder than expected in And what surprised you?

11:36 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Well, what was a little bit hard, based on my experience when I work on the program, was that, like, you know, the program is having, the Smart Start program is having good intentions, but there was a little bit of resistance from the existing ECD owners. As early childhood development, like your crashes in the area. And they felt threatened by the project that, you know, the smart start is going to be taking this, whenever they see a child, they see a business. And if someone is starting a similar initiative, they get threatened. So there was some resistance from the local ECD practitioners who were running the crashes in the area. But as we were engaging with them, they then noticed that Smart Start is not a threat, but it's also complementing them very well. Hence, like as you know, in the Smart Start journey of Smart Start value chain, there is a component where before you start doing the training, you engage with the ECD principles and you you provide them with the induction. And they said, oh, wow, yeah, so this program is not a threat, but it's actually complementing us. And some of them, you find that right now, even in the ECD centres that they are running, you find that there are also ECD practitioners that are trained to be part of the Smart Start or they are part of the Smart Start program. And also, the other thing that we normally do, whenever we start in a new area, we normally start doing the community engagement process just to introduce the program. But at early stages, you'll find that there are pushbacks, but as you engage with them, then the pushbacks disappear. Then they notice that, wow, this program is complementing us. It's not a threat.

14:06 - vule Tshvhs
And on seeing impact, can you describe a moment when you realized this work was making a real difference for children, practitioners, or communities?

14:19 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Well, it's very impactful in terms of the space where we are working at as Lima. We are implementing the program in the informal settlements of The city of Tshwane. And the informal settlements, there is a high level of poverty and a high rate of unemployment. And they said that the program is being implemented in Mamelodi to be specific, Soshanguve, Bronkhorstspruit, Hammanskraal, Mabopane and Garankuwa. But in the early stages we were implementing it in Mamelodi, Soshanguve and then we expanded in Bronkhorstspruit, Hammanskraal, Mabopane and Garankuwa. So in terms of the impact, right now as Lima we are having 1,000 250 franchisees that are on the program, that are benefiting from the program. And in our database, we are having 12,174 children. And also, we receive good, positive results from the great art teachers, the children that are part of the Smart Start program performing very well at school as compared to other children so the program like you know it's value adding and it's improving the quality of life of the children yeah okay and on shaping the platform as much that describes franchises as leaders who helped shape the platform itself in what ways did experience influence how Smartstart works today?

16:25 - vule Tshvhs
Smartstart describes franchises as leaders who helped shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how Smartstart works today?

16:37 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
It's like you know the constant provision, coaching, and support that is provided to the franchisees to manage their programs in an effective manner. Like, you know, they're intertwining a relationship between Smart Start Lima and the franchisees. It's adding a lot of value.

17:12 - vule Tshvhs
And yes?

17:15 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like, you know, like, you know, even like, you know, the awards, the franchisees normally gets, it helps them to be recognized and yeah, on an annual basis that, oh, wow, we are being listened to and we are being recognized by Smart Start for the work that we are doing. And some of them are getting stipends as the areas where we are working at informal services areas with high rate of unemployment, hence parents are unable to pay for their children. But some are able, but not all of them. But the little bit of the stipend that is provided by Smart Start to the franchisees is adding a lot of value, it keeps them moving. And because now they started the Smart Start program based on their passion. If they're passionate about the program, then yeah, and about working with children, it's adding a lot of value.

18:16 - vule Tshvhs
And moving to communities, much of Smart Starts reach came from franchises opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?

18:30 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Well, as I've mentioned that our point of entry before we start any new site, we do commit engagement where we engage with the ECD practitioners, various stakeholders, your local leadership structures, and community members just to introduce the program. So, like, you know, whenever you go to any community, if you bypass, you know, the key gatekeepers in the community, then you'll find yourself in deep trouble. So like we normally do a six months committee engagement program just to build trust and relationship with the local stakeholders. So that they understand the program, your plans and deal with their fears or in a way address their fears. Hence, as I've mentioned that There was resistance with the ECD practitioners, but after they understood what the program is all about, and they were part of the principal's induction, then they noticed that, no, no, this program is not a threat, but it's actually complementing us.

19:57 - vule Tshvhs
And speaking on practitioners, thinking about the practitioners support, how have you seen them change over time professionally or personally?

20:10 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Professionally and personally. And personally, OK, yeah, yeah. OK, in terms, their attitude has improved on how the program is being run. And also, because, you know, they are one, a person who is recruited to be part of the Smart Start is someone who is passionate about the Smart Start program or about working with children. So most of them, they are passionate about working with children. And they continue to provide good quality services according to the Smart Start value chain, and also improving the quality of education of the children. I can't remember the real question, really.

21:06 - vule Tshvhs
No, no. I was saying you can even share it if there's a specific story, like a practitioner story that you'd also like to share. That's also okay.

21:16 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Okay, like, you know, like, you know, they manage to run their, their, this must start a project in their own homes and run it as a business, as a an effective business, and they're taking care of the children. And some have started food security gardens in their centers. And the other add-on in other sites, they are receiving nutritional porridges from Dumo Foundation. It's only in Atteridgeville, Malemelodi and Mabopane, but whenever there is an excess, we normally share it with other children. And the positive response that we normally get from the local school teachers in terms of the performance of the Smart Start children, it's providing us with a positive, showing good impact of the program. And also, Last Year, I trained about 210 franchises, provided training on new venture creation on how to run effective businesses. And the training was conducted in Social Government, Bronco Sprint and Mami Lodi. And that resulted in the franchises running effective businesses.

22:55 - vule Tshvhs
And reflecting on the children and the families, can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?

23:09 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
I would just like, you know, what can I say? Provide an overall... Feedback you don't normally get. The parents are happy about the children, I mean, the children's performance, because they are getting quality education. And also the children, whenever you engage with them, you notice the happiness in their face. And like, you know, because now it's learn and play and like, you know, and where they are getting, like, you know, nutritional porridge is addressing their nutritional needs as they come from impoverished families. And the other thing, like, you know, as you know, that in South Africa, there is a high rate of unemployment and the program per se is really, like, you know, contributing in a way to create job opportunities for the locally unemployed. Because, like, you know, you find that, you know, the smart starters who are the franchisees or practitioners that were on the programme are now grown and they are principals of the centres and they are creating job opportunities for other unemployed individuals in the area. So, it's multifaceted. A positive contribution that is happening in the community. And hence, some are still working as franchises and creating job opportunities and also providing good quality education for the children and also taking care of the children while the parents are on duty and the safety of children, because these days there's lots of violence that can happen if a mother is leaving a child all by herself. So it's providing a place of safety for children to be taken care of And you find that, you know, whilst the parent is still at work, the franchisees are also providing, they also take care of the children for, even extended hours, not for strict hours, like one, maybe from seven to one, whatever. We find that they provide their aftercare services as well. So there's trust between the franchises, children, and the parents, and the parents can focus on doing their work, knowing that their children are being taken care of, and there's a good relationship between the parents and the franchise, and the UCD practitioners. And the children, they like the practitioners. Whenever they see them, they are so happy. It's like an extended family.

26:28 - vule Tshvhs
On challenges, what is the hardest part of being a Franchisor that people outside SMART start often don't see or understand?

26:40 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
While the main challenge, I will go back to the societal issues. As I've said, the program is being implemented in the informal settlement with the high rate of unemployment and poverty. Like, you know, even though pay franchisee is passionate about the program, but because, you know, the driver, there's an economic element as a driver that they should also provide money for their families. But if their parents are unable to pay for the children, then it becomes a challenge. But they soldier on. But to address that, they really appreciate the support that is being provided by Smart Start in terms of the stipend. As you know, there is a 500 stipend or 550 stipend from jobs fund, but even though the stipend, I'm told that it's not consistent. Some are getting it and some are not getting it. So that needs to be addressed.

27:58 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, then that leads me to the next question. What is still missing?

28:06 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Well, like, you know, for those that are seeking, like, you know, financial support, if they could be assisted with the stipend, because, you know, I'm normally engaged with the coaches, the Lima coaches, and some of the franchisees are frustrated that, like, you know, So the stipend, I think they need to manage the system to make sure that they are paying the right people. The stipend is received by the right people. Because there are instances where you find that the stipend, even though it's 500 rand, it's not enough. But if the stipend is being given based on human error, I will assume, to someone who is no longer on the program and someone who is on the program is not getting a stipend that is a demotivator. So they must be able to track and trace if the people that are being paid the stipend are still on the program. And that is completely beyond the control of coaches, because they're submitting the required documents for the existing franchises, and they deactivate the franchises on the Smartstart link, and only to find that when the stipend is being paid, the stipend that is paid to someone who's no longer on the program who has been deactivated, And what have you learned over the past about 10 early learning, communities, leadership or yourself? Well, what I've learned is that like, you know, it's important to provide early childhood development for children at an early age, because you know, if you do that, it has positive spin-offs for the child, quality of life in the long term.

30:39 - Unidentified Speaker
And for communities?

30:41 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
And the communities, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, if a child is educated, like, let's say, because, you know, like, you know, they will complete school and then the community will strive.

31:02 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah, and about yourself? It's learning about communities, leadership or yourself. Is there something you had to unlearn?

31:16 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Okay, I will say in terms of the leadership for the franchises, the coaching session that they normally get from the coaches, it helps them to improve their leadership qualities. And also work based on Lima, like, you know, Lima is based, head office is in Pietermaritzburg and the program is running Um, in how thing and we have appointed someone to be a program leader based in Pretoria to work closely with the coaches, um, that are providing coaching support to the franchises to make sure that the quote the franchises are, um, doing their work in an appropriate manner so then in terms of the leadership it's like you know it's a two-way street like they both benefit and also our team they also benefit because you know there are like you know sessions that are being held with smart start where the coaches are being trained and supported by the relationship managers. And if they are having any problems, they know that they have to go to people from Smart Start to solve those problems. So it has improved their leadership qualities as well. But for me, per se, as I'm based here in Pietermaritzburg. Like, you know, whilst I was still directly involved in Smart Start as a program leader, yeah, I was gaining a lot, but now within Lima, there has been some changes since last Year where we appointed, I mean, the old managing director equivalent to a CEO, sort of went to pension, partial pension, and then a new managing director was appointed. And I had to step down a bit and give the opportunity to the new MD to understand the context of this But she's still learning. And yeah, I'm not sure if it's making sense. Transition within the organization. That's what we need to deal with. But now like, you know, I'm not 100% 100% directly involved on the smart start. But I'm trying to hand over but she's trying to learn. And as I said, like, you know, the problems that Lima is running is not only any childhood development, like any other organization, like, you know, your, I mean, LIMA is running various programs and projects and yeah. And early childhood development, it's not our area of specialization. But we are, we are learning.

35:02 - vule Tshvhs
And during the time that you've been working with Smartstart, What makes you proud of that role?

35:12 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
The constant support that I was receiving from Smartstart and the relationship manager. There was someone that I had to go to if I was encountering problems or with regards to the implementation of problems and the support.

35:31 - vule Tshvhs
It was very much And on looking ahead, as much that looks for toward the next decade, what do you think franchises will need in order to succeed or at even greater scale?

35:53 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Well, I will say as they are running the the franchise early childhood development program as a business, if they could be trained on how to run it as an effective and efficient business. As I've related that those that have received training are now expanding and are able to create job opportunities. So if they are trained on how to run effective, businesses and also I remember there was, I'm not sure if they are still providing it, I think they need to be trained to be qualified ECD practitioners to get the, I think the early childhood development qualification, NQF level four. And some of them are receiving that early childhood development in QF level four. And then the other thing I didn't share on the impact of the program, just thinking as I'm talking about this, is that like, you know, there were engagements during my tenure and is still going on with the Department of Basic Education to have the centres of the franchises being registered with the Department of Basic Education, and we have seen positive results in the sense that currently we have one who has gold, 500 bronze, and 150 of them are still waiting for bronze application feedback, and 180 I've submitted the silver application. So like, you know, if we get the support from the government and that will help to strengthen the program that is run by the franchises. And also the food security gardens, as we always say, education and food goes hand in hand. If each and every centre could maybe have a small food garden because there is even agriculture, children will get nutritious vegetable from the garden. But the thing is, we're not sure at this point in time where to get funding to start the food security gardens, but some have started the food security gardens So children are getting quality education and also getting good meals.

39:03 - vule Tshvhs
And our last question. If you could say one thing to South Africa about what Smart Start has achieved, what would it be?

39:16 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
I would say it's improving. It provides the provision of good quality education at an early stage.

39:34 - vule Tshvhs
My questions have run out. Thank you so much for making the time. We deeply appreciate your perspective. Thank you so much.

39:45 - NTOMBIFUTHI VICTORIA SIBEKO
Thank you.

39:46 - Unidentified Speaker

0:46 - Mark Misselhorn
Hello, good day, Mark.

0:49 - vule Tshvhs
Hi, Gule, how are you?

0:50 - Mark Misselhorn
I'm good, thanks. How are you doing today?

0:52 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah, I'm okay, thank you.

0:58 - Mark Misselhorn
Are you ready?

1:00 - Mark Misselhorn
Yeah, I mean, give me a bit of background if you if you can, because I didn't see a lot of detail. Just maybe tell me what the purpose is, and what sort of questions you want to ask, and how the content is going to be utilized.

1:17 - Unidentified Speaker
Oh, OK.

1:17 - Mark Misselhorn
So you're welcome to record, by the way. I've got no objection to that.

1:20 - vule Tshvhs
Well, OK.

1:21 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that, because I was just about to ask that. Thank you. Thank you. So my name is Vuledzani. We are, I'm from a company called Auxeira, and we were commissioned to write a 10-Year Report for Smart Start. So we just want to reflect back with the franchises about the past 10 years. So your experiences working within the communities, your journey, how you came to partner up with Smart Start, and the impact with working with Smart Start, practitioners experiences and communities, your own personal reflections as well, the learning that maybe took place within in the past 10 years around anything that had to do with working with Smart Start. We are using this, this is for the purpose of the, we are writing a 10 So this Interview is for that purpose.

2:31 - Mark Misselhorn
All right. Now, will I be quoted?

2:35 - vule Tshvhs
So there is an option to opt out from being quoted. It's one of the last questions I was going to ask you.

2:42 - Mark Misselhorn
Well, either being quoted directly or statements or experience being attributed to PPT, either way, all I ask is I'm happy for that, but I would like to see that content so I can approve it before it goes.

2:59 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, I'll make a note of that.

3:01 - Mark Misselhorn
I think it's useful to be able to, you know, I don't want you to feel restricted where you would want to refer PPT's experience or it could be Tree's experience or whatever you might, you might want to be specific as opposed to general. And you may even have quotes that you think are worth putting in. So I'm quite happy with that. But if we're going to be referenced either me directly or PPT, just run it by me so I can make sure it's, I'm happy with it that it's accurate, et cetera. So it doesn't create, can easily be something, can be slightly out of context and then be contextually inaccurate or create the wrong impression. So on that basis, I'm happy.

3:40 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, definitely. Definitely we'll keep you abreast on the Report and I will have someone more senior contact you about that as well.

3:51 - Mark Misselhorn
And then the other thing is, you know, the person that you really should speak to is our smart start lead, Nannan Law. I mean, he works with the, you know, our coaches, activators, and with the franchisees directly. So, you know, I can give you the big picture, maybe the more strategic picture, but as far as the nuts and bolts stuff, Nanna is by far person to talk to.

4:21 - vule Tshvhs
Do you think we should schedule a meeting with her?

4:26 - Mark Misselhorn
Well, it's actually him. He's got an unusual name. Nana's normally a woman, but in this case, I think we should just go for it now because to try and bring him in, I mean, I think you can talk to him, just have a separate discussion with him. I think it's short notice to pull him into this discussion. But I'm happy to, but yeah, I mean, if you want to reschedule, can we both, both in the discussion, that's also okay, but we're here now, so I could also give you feedback.

4:59 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, or whatever questions maybe that you might not have, like responses to that he might know more about, then maybe he could email me back with the details that also Yeah, well, then I think I'll leave it to you to follow up with them about that.

5:18 - Mark Misselhorn
I don't really want to be following up with them, you know, separately. So, you know, that's another thing that I've then got to do relay stuff and make requests. So, just take notes of things. I'll just tell you as I'm going things that are better to check with Nana. You can pick up with a short follow-up discussion or email if necessary.

5:39 - vule Tshvhs
All right. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, so we can start. Okay, so just going back on the journey, can you take me back to when you first became a Smartstart Franchisor?

5:55 - Mark Misselhorn
Yeah, so I think that, you know, the basis on which we became a Franchisor was on the back of extensive work that we did as PBT dating back to 2013. In the Etigwene metro, but also in other provinces and with national government, where we were seeking to research and establish a population-based ECD response model that worked in underserviced communities like informal settlements and townships and rural areas, because based on our experience, experience dating back to our establishment in 1993. And increasingly over time, since then, we saw large numbers of children in these areas who were vulnerable, who were either in very, very under-resourced ECD centres, or child mining, or who had no care at all, and were just like on the street, as it were, wandering around informal settlements. So, this really concerned us, and we saw no evidence of any proactive outreach by anyone to go into these areas and do something about this problem. And so we started in 2013 with partners like the DPME, DigiMari Trust, Ilifa Labantwana and many others in first getting data, proper survey data on what was happening in these areas because no one had ever surveyed you know, the centres and the sites and to understand, you know, how many children there were and what the constraints and opportunities were and barriers and challenges that affected these many children and ECD sites in these areas. And so, yeah, we did a lot of work getting good data. We did the first big surveys on, ECDs in these areas. In Etigwene, we, I think, surveyed then I think we also surveyed other municipalities. I think in total, we ended up surveying more than 1,200 ECD, under-resourced ECDs in Etigwene and also in other parts of KZN and other provinces. And we got data that no one had before about what some of the challenges were, including serious problems with infrastructure. Serious problems with the lack of resources, obviously, the affordability, how much parents can pay, with the fact that many centres are privately owned and private operators put their own money into these sites that really fulfil a public good, but they're not making a lot of money. They're operating on a very survivalist basis and providing a community service. So it was a very extensive survey. There was, you know, well over you know, 360 fields that we gathered in that data. And then on the basis of that, we developed an approach, a response model, what's often now called ecosystem change in ECD. We developed a guide for a municipal guide to help municipalities understand their role. We helped the Ethekwini Metro in developing an ECD strategy which was very groundbreaking, did that in consultation with the Department of Social Development and all the other stakeholders, COCTA, et cetera. This was before Department of Education took over from Department of Social Development. As you know, they took over the ECD function a couple of years ago. And I think we were invited by Smart Start to become a Franchisor because of this extensive experience and because we had a strong local knowledge and we were an organization with good capacity and track record and experience and we've done a lot of the groundwork in respect of figuring out how you address this challenge of ECD in a scalable, replicable and cost-efficient So I think what Smart Start offers is a pretty streamlined, well thought through and appropriate support intervention that can meet the needs of many of these grassroots operators, which met a particular need that we identified. I don't think it solves all of the problems, but it's the only initiative of its kind in the country, which is programmatic, which is scalable and functioning at scale, and which can be accessible to these very under-resourced ECD operators at grassroots level, who often don't have a lot of time. They certainly don't have a lot of money. And the Smart Start program is one that is outreach-orientated, reaches out into areas and it provides incremental support and it's flexible. So it doesn't require, for example, centres to or sites to meet maybe all of the requirements that may be required for partial care registration at gold level or even silver level. So I think the reason for PPT partnering in becoming a Franchisor is really that we, I think we both share this understanding that the needs are very great. The challenges are very profound and that we need to have solutions that are scalable and therefore that are incremental and very resource efficient and that are flexible and talk to the real needs and situation of, you know, grassroots ECD operators, whether they're childminders, whether they are the people who run centres, and whether or not they are smart start franchisees. Yeah, I think one of the things that has emerged as being really significant is that if you've spoken to other people, you will have heard people talking about mass registration, and a lot of hope is being put on sites registering at silver level and government, the Department of Education and others have set down what they think are reasonable minimum standards for silver. And at silver level, you can then get the subsidy from the DOE per child subsidy, which gives you a little bit more operating funding in your centre, which then enables you to hopefully provide a much better service. Because parents can only pay, in the eThekwini metro, 200, rand is what most low income households can afford to pay. And that's just not enough. If you multiply that by 20 or 30, or perhaps in some sites as many as 40 children, that just doesn't give you enough money to pay qualified practitioners, pay for food, pay for equipment, materials, your lights, water, and all the other costs, which is often why your ECD operators, who are often private, most of them are, are actually subsidizing these sites from their personal income and running them with very, very low level of financial return. So one of the challenges is that that silver registration standard, even though it is more flexible than the full partial care requirements, for a centre, for an ECD centre. And whilst some sites are going to be able to achieve it, many, many sites are not going to be able to meet that standard. So we've just done a new survey. We're just busy writing up the data now. We did 284 centres and childminders, a mix of both. And we've got the data on that and we'll have a Report out quite soon. But what it's showing is that there are many, many sites. We think at least 40% of the sites, both centres and semi home-based centre sites, are not gonna be able to achieve silver registration because they've got not enough space or because the ECD site isn't sufficiently separated from the home. So, yeah, we're mindful that MRD and silver registration is very important. It's a major development in South Africa, but it's not the silver bullet. It's not going to reach all the children and all of the sites, and many are going to be left out. And I think common ground that we have with Smart Start is an appreciation of this, that we still need to do more in terms of reaching out to all of those many sites and many ECD operators and many children who are not, at least in the short term, if not the long term, going to succeed at getting civil registration and therefore getting operational subsidy from government.

15:42 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that insight. But in partnering up with Smart Start, did you have any concerns?

15:54 - Mark Misselhorn
No, I think we partnered because there is so much to gain by collaboration. I think the only limitation is that the smart start model funded on quite a tight basis. It's trying to be cost-efficient. So, I think the base assumption is that the organization that is the Franchisor has other funding that they're getting from other donors for the operational costs, because the costs of running an ECD program for PPT is significant because it's not just the direct smart start work. You've got to engage with the municipality. In the case of eThekwini and to a degree, the KZN DAE and other stakeholders, they rely on us to provide support. So we're not just to make smart start work. You can't just do the work of reaching out and doing matching days and doing drives and then finding franchisees and training them and capacitating them and getting them up and running and supporting them. There's a whole lot of other work you've got to do, which is the ecosystem change, the systemic work, because you've got to do this so that it can be scaled and be sustainable. You've got to also work very, very closely with government to make sure they understand what you're doing, but also because there are a lot of things that government needs to do differently so that Smart Start and other ECD interventions can work at scale. There are a lot of barriers, for example, regarding registration that I've mentioned, regarding the coordination between environmental health practitioners and social workers, municipal EHPs and DAE social workers. There's the need to structure infrastructure support programs so that you can address infrastructure at sites. There's the regulatory flexibility that you need. So there's a whole host of work that happens in the background so that ECD can be scaled up and all these many barriers and problems can be overcome. Smart start on its own can produce and is producing big impact, but we're not going to get a complete transformation and meet the bold national objective of reaching all children. I mean, people talk about 2030, that's very unlikely to happen, but we want it to happen as soon as possible. We wanna reach as many as possible. To do that, smart start's not enough on its own. There've gotta be a lot of other things that change. Just making MRD work well, notwithstanding that it can't reach all sites. And we know, so even then, MRD itself isn't a silver bullet, but just to make MRD reach all the sites that it can reach requires a lot of collaborative work. For example, as I've mentioned, effective coordination between municipalities and provincial DAEs, between EHPs and social workers, the kind of flexibility, getting on the same page about standards, and just the capacity to visit all sites because And the Department of Education just doesn't have enough social workers. In Etigwene, they've got nine social workers. For a metro, where there's 400 thousand children, you know, five and under, it's gonna take decades with that number of social workers to reach, to go and visit, you know, all the sites. So there are a lot of limitations, and SMART starts to keep of it, but a lot of other work has to happen. In that respect, the Smart Start model is for PPT as a Franchisor, it puts a burden on us because we've got to also constantly seek other funding to do all that other work. Because even though that work is what enables us to be a good Franchisor and deliver the good results that we've delivered, that's not directly funded by Smart Start. And I know this is something that also would face other franchisors. I don't think it's a criticism of the Smart Start model, but it's more saying that there is a huge value and a huge reliance in respect of the many well-capacitated civil society organizations like PPE, and Tree and Let's See and all of the Smart Start franchisors, and there are other organizations too. But the whole sector relies massively on these organizations in lots of ways. It's not just to do the Smart Start signing up franchisees work. It's doing all sorts of policy work, training work, strategy work, coordination work, innovation, infrastructure support, data collection, and the capacity capacity in government is highly constrained. Government is really, really struggling at all three spheres. It is heavily under-resourced in terms of the ECD task. And I think the civil society sector is largely carrying the load, has the best knowledge, information, data, capacity, skills, et cetera. But I think they are very So that I don't think was a concern or hesitation in terms of involving ourselves and partnering with Smartstart. But it's something that we're very mindful of is that we and a lot of other CSOs like us are heavily stretched and we need to collaboratively see how we resource the civil society sector because it's a very efficient sector. Not just the capacity and skills, et cetera, but just the efficiency and commitment that you'll find in leading CSOs like PPT. And you compare it to government. You know, it's, Smartstart often talks about 10X. You want to go 10X in scale. Well, I'd say CSOs are 10X what government does on general. You know, if you take the same amount of money and you put it in government and you try and get work done, what a CSO, I can do is probably 10x, there's 10x probably there. I'm not suggesting that we divert fiscal resources directly from government departments to CSOs, but what I am saying is that funding civil society organisations more effectively produces a big gearing. It's certainly a better gearing than resourcing government directly, because I think of the level of skill and commitment and experience of these organizations. So, yeah, so that's a standout thing for me is, and it's been raised, Smartstart knows this, and I think other franchisors also struggle with that, and it's a cross-cutting problem. You know, maybe at some point, government itself can find a way to help address this resource challenge that faces CSOs like VPT.

23:42 - vule Tshvhs
You give very detailed responses and I'm afraid we might not get to all the questions within the time that we have been provided. So please just try and keep the responses short, please. Thank you. But reflecting back on the early years of partnering up with Smart Start, how was the first Year in practice.

24:12 - Unidentified Speaker
The first Year?

24:16 - vule Tshvhs
Can you reflect back on that?

24:18 - Mark Misselhorn
Look, I didn't get that from Nana, but for us it was obviously just understanding the systems, building the capacity, understanding how the model works and testing it in our local environment. So it was exploratory. The first Year was very much, let's see how it goes in Year one, because we hadn't, done this sort of work directly before. So yeah, we took a strategic decision to test it. So it was very much a Year of testing and trial and experimentation, testing whether we felt that this was going to work for us. We didn't get good results, which we did get.

24:59 - vule Tshvhs
And just to reflect on the impact. When did you realise that this was making a real difference for children, practitioners and the community?

25:13 - Mark Misselhorn
I'm just looking here at when our numbers started to really kick up. And I think from a qualitative point of view, we realised very quickly that this was well received and relevant. So from a qualitative point of view, we knew it pretty quickly. From a quantitative numbers, scale point of view, I think from Year two, we really started to see our numbers go up well. And I think in this last Year, the 2025, Smart Start had its 10 Year celebrations, we won quite a few awards for the fastest growing franchise I think we won four awards in total, or three awards in total. And I think it did, I was there at that function. I was surprised. I don't go around comparing what we do to other organizations. And I was very, I was surprised, but also obviously it was very rewarding to get those awards. But it did show that we're doing a good job, but it also shows that in a place like the Durban Metro, high populations, there's a huge upside potential with intervening because of the numbers and the scale and also the stakeholders that you have.

26:45 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that. I think the next question you touched on it in some of the questions that I asked previously, but let's reflect back on This again, Smart Starts describes franchisors as leaders who help shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how Smart Start works today?

27:11 - Mark Misselhorn
Probably the best example, there might be a few others, but one that definitely stands out is the idea of regional hubs. Where franchisors, either individually or collectively at an area level, focus on scaling up, taking measures to scale up in various types of measures. It could be partnering with other organizations, onboarding other partners, or it could be working with government in different ways. And so I think KZN or  eThekwini and Eastern Cape were the two areas PPT and Kurulega, I think, drove the first efforts at a regional hub work. Which is a way of smart start starting to think about scale in a more programmatic sort of way. So I think we've played a huge role in that. And our regional hub work in Etigwene is going pretty well. We've done the survey work and we supported the ECD strategy implementation and some of the things I've mentioned around registration coordination and regulatory flexibility, et cetera. Because as I've said, there's a lot of as moving parts in an ECD ecosystem. It's not just what Smart Start does, there are a lot of other things that have to change if we're going to get scale.

29:01 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that. Okay, now let's reflect on communities. Much of Smart Start's reach came from franchises opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?

29:18 - Mark Misselhorn
I don't know about this, he can give you details, but the short answer is PPT, we were established in 1993 before the first democratic elections. We were established to work with communities and government, our primary clients, our primary beneficiaries are communities. So we work with communities all the time. So we understand them. We understand how you engage, we know the areas. So we just really experienced working in these areas, which doesn't mean that it's problem free and that you don't have issues sometimes. There can be various stakeholders that can be problematic at times and you have to deal with that. But yeah, you need to know how to engage in a consultative way. You need to know how to talk to people in the community in the right way. You need to know who the leadership is and what the protocols are and that Don't tread on people's toes and each area is different. It's not like there's one formula and you follow a tick box exercise. Sometimes if you talk too much to a counsellor, you can have as much problem as talking to him or her too little, depends on the counsellor. So as an example, you need to be quite smart about how you engage because it's not just a formula. Every area is different. Some are more sensitive. Is a very, very volatile province, as you know. So in case it in, you've got to be really, really careful because there can be very high levels of volatility and conflict, which can often be more political than developmental, but it's easy to get swept up in them. But we've found very high receptiveness and lots of operators that want to be part of Smart Start. So it's gone well for us. But talk to him a little bit more, you'll probably get more useful information from him. None has been involved in community work and participative work and development work for even longer than I have, he's got huge experience.

31:29 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, I'll certainly do that. And I think the next two questions as well, focus more on the developmental side. I think you might say, Nana would probably be the best person to answer them. About practitioners, okay. Thinking about the practitioners you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally or personally?

31:53 - Mark Misselhorn
Yeah, Nana can give you more, but I mean, I've seen, I've seen franchisees and I've also seen coaches absolutely blow me away completely. In terms of their ability to understand and communicate what they do, what Smart Start does, and be incredibly decisive and strong advocates of change. When we did our launch in eThekwini, which is now two years ago, I was, I mean, I spoke in Smart Start hub, spoke and so did other people, but we also had franchisees and coaches speaking. And yeah, I mean, I have to say, I was extremely impressed by the sort of, just the calibre of people that do this work. One might think that, you know, grassroots ECD operators like franchisees are insignificant, or lesser because they don't earn a lot of money or they don't have a lot of resources. But they're incredibly resourceful, tenacious, intelligent, and solution-orientated people. I mean, I spoke with various franchisees and some, you know, took the opportunity to, you know, engage me directly to see if I could directly help them, which I thought was very enterprising. You know, just come straight up to PVD CEO and say, can you help me, I've got a problem, which is really cool. It shows the kind of confidence and that you understand how to communicate issues and negotiate with stakeholders and with power.

33:53 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you. Thank you for that. I think this question, you are probably the best suited person to respond to. What is the hardest part of being a Franchisor that people outside Smartstart often don't see or understand?

34:08 - Mark Misselhorn
Let's get rid of that. Sorry, that was an incoming call that interfered with my... I'm just going to say I'll call back, otherwise it's going to interfere because it also comes up on my computer. Look, I don't think, look, the first one is definitely the funding that it requires to do a really good job for me and for other senior people in PPT to drive a program like this behind the scenes. It just doesn't happen. You can talk to any Franchisor. You don't just set up a smart start system and organize that doesn't have extensive networks, understanding, trust, trust. And that trust, you win it over time, but you can lose it in five minutes. You can't just show up some of the time, you've got to show up all of the time. And all of that takes time, it takes budget, it takes continual commitment. So the Smart Start model is as good as its franchisors and their level of commitment and the Hub Smart Start fully understands this and celebrates it. But as I've said, most people would not understand how much it takes for a franchise organization to do all the work that's required to be able to be effective as a Franchisor, because it's not just the smart start work, it's all that other trust relationship overcoming barriers and being part of that ecosystem on a continual basis and showing up all the time. Otherwise, one loses the sort of position and the trust. You know, probably the other thing people don't understand is what it's like on the ground for ECD operators. Most people have not got a cooking clue what it is like to walk around an informal settlement or even a township, and to understand the environment, the challenges, the infrastructure, the settlement pattern, how little space there is, how much risk and threat and vulnerability there is, how acutely under-resourced ECD operators are, how highly stressed they are. And so very often, I think policymakers and many other academics and a lot of people involved in the ecosystem. They sit quite high up in the system. They're in policy tanks or NGOs or universities or in government. And they're quite far away from what's happening on the ground. They spend a lot of time communicating with other people in their part of the ecosystem. And most of them spend almost no time talking to the people on the ground. CSOs like PPT are kind of the bridge in between. So we see both worlds. We can be in both of these worlds, this world of policy and trying to produce a better regulatory environment and so on and so forth. But we're also in the world of the real day-to-day constraints and opportunities. And how amazing these grassroots women, mainly these ECD operators, whether they're franchises on how amazing and resourceful these people are and what they do every day and how astonishingly fantastic it is even if it doesn't meet all the standards that government would like to see. And these worlds are so far apart that it's quite stressful to be in the position we're in because we can see how big this gap is in common understanding between these two worlds, the world of the operator on the ground and the world of the policymaker think tanks and the government agents of change at the top end of the system. So that for me would be the second thing people don't understand enough is, and that's why we do survey work. We try to get hard data to help people understand what we can see, but which often they cannot see. Small start is pretty well dialled in because it's It also has branches. It has some grassroots contact and it works with franchise. So I think Smart Starts pretty rooted, but I think many of the other stakeholders aren't practical and realistic enough about how much flexibility is required. And probably the best example of that is that many people think that MRD is the silver bullet. And that by getting sites to silver registration, we're going to solve the problem of ECD in South Africa. We've now got hard data. And with only people who've got this data, it astonishes me that PPT is the only organization that's going on the ground and getting this data. Everyone else has a theory of change based on, let's say, ideology and policy, but they're not checking it against what's happening on the ground. So that concern that feels like it shouldn't really be our job to try and do that reality checking, but no one else is doing it. So we are doing it with limited money and with fairly small surveys, but it is giving us hard data that shows that MRD is going to reach quite a few sites, but it's by no means going to reach all of them. We think 30 to 40% of the children are not going to be reached and that you can't overcome that wall, that barrier easily. It's not like you can just go in and solve infrastructure, space problems, or the fact that a site's not separated from the home. It's not possible to go and build tens of thousands of new ECD centres in South Africa as the answer to ECD. I don't think anyone seriously believes we've got the money or the capacity to manage those facilities. We've got to find ways to support the grassroots people that do ECD, which is what Smart Start does, in an incremental way. And so a much greater sense of realism is required about incremental outreach and accepting that silver registration, MRD, is one way and one important way, but it's not the only one. And we need to find ways to reach out in a more flexible and incremental manner to what could be as much as half or at least a third of all the children that are currently going to be locked out of MRD. They're going to be excluded with the best intentions of the world. We've developed something which is meant to be inclusive, but we've built standards in which are going to exclude. And so we need at least another strategy which is more flexible and which accepts this very constrained reality on the ground.

41:32 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that. The next question, I think you have touched on it as well, but it focuses on learning. What have you learned over the past 10 years about early learning, communities, leadership and yourself.

41:53 - Mark Misselhorn
Okay, so I'm assuming you're going to note those two points I just gave you as learning around the resourcing of CSOs and how ecosystem change needs to include even the most under-resourced ECD operators that aren't going to make it into MRD. That government is receptive to partnership, and they are serious about that, even if they can't always be flexible enough. But the door is open. And that's good. On the downside, I think there's still not enough realism about how much flexibility and incrementalism you actually need. So I think there are two sides to that point, which are very important to note. And then definitely collaborating with other organizations, sharing resources, sharing learning work, definitely pays dividends. Smartstart's been very good at that. Moving coalition of organizations and so have other organizations have been good at, Ilifa Labantwna and others have been good at finding ways to collaborate. So I think that is definitely been a good learning. Often CSOs are busy and you don't have time to understand what other people are doing. But you can learn and you can get more done collaboratively than working in isolation.

43:47 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you again for that. You are so insightful. We have three more questions left. Can you briefly just let me know that when you look back over the past decade, what makes you proud about the role that you've played in Smart Start?

44:08 - Mark Misselhorn
In Smart Start? I'll recap with just like what would be the main points to extract from what I've said already. Obviously the numbers, you know, it is very cool, it's gratifying, it's rewarding to get, to achieve good numbers. We've got, what is it at the moment, cumulative franchise We've got, I'll tell you now, it's good to remind myself what the number is, because I just got an updated Report and it had gone up. Yeah, we've got 794 franchisees, sorry, 676 active, because some of those, no, 676 active franchisees and 6,500. And that's great. But also mindful that that is a drop in the ocean. You've literally got to 10X that to start to have numbers that are really gonna make a difference in a place like eThekwini Metro. So I think that's an important one.

45:31 - vule Tshvhs
What makes you most proud of your role?

45:35 - Mark Misselhorn
So I think the numbers, I think the partnership and collaboration in the eThekwini Metro and the expanded number of organizations that we are bringing to bear. To get a real collective metro level program, which is a major, it's a big city, more than 4 million people, more than 400,000 young children. So I think that's, we're proud of that. Certainly, as I said, I'm very proud of the franchisees and our team And I think collectively, you know, Smart Start itself has, which is the network of franchisors, has really stood up and been able to play a very valuable national role, you know, in terms of changing things.

46:49 - vule Tshvhs
You have touched on this question a bit. So again, briefly, as much as that looks forward to the next decade, what do you think franchises will need in order to succeed at even greater scale?

47:08 - Mark Misselhorn
Better infrastructure. As our efforts continue, we will increasingly start to run out of sites that have adequate infrastructure, whether it is smart spacing standards or whether it's silver level registration standards. So that either means you need to solve that problem in one way or another, which could mean you find the established cost efficient infrastructure support programs, the government programs are very slow and they're too small. So we are busy working on one for the Etigwene Metro, which we're making good progress with, which will be in place by the end of the Year. Major platform, big with external donor funding, which we have achieved in part because of our partnership with Smart Start and our prior work. You're going to have to do a lot more flexibility or you're going to have to find other ways of solving this infrastructure problem. So that's definitely one of the the biggest problems. The EOF, the outcomes fund program that you would have heard that's now Smart Starts taking on, is specifically focusing on new ELPs in eThekwini Metro. And particularly as you start to try and establish new sites, new access, not just assisting existing ones, infrastructure really is a limit In fact, just finding a space that is big enough, clean enough, healthy enough, it's got adequate toilets and hand washing and ventilation and all the rest is difficult in, I think, in both rural and urban context in South Africa, but certainly in the Durban metro, which has got both rural and urban. But it's maybe most difficult where you've got high dense, high density settlements like informal settlements or townships where there just isn't a lot of space. So even if you've got money, it's difficult to just fix problems by throwing money at the problem. It's not just money. You need flexibility and a real open mind as to how you're going to address infrastructure. Because if children are there and you're not able to help because your hands are tied by not enough regulatory flexibility or your standards are too, stricter, you haven't got infrastructure, funding, money, the children are still there, they don't go away. And so I think that's probably, you know, worth noting.

49:59 - vule Tshvhs
And our last question, briefly again, if you could say one thing to South Africa about what Smart Start has achieved, what would it be?

50:09 - Mark Misselhorn
I'd say Smartstart has been able to reach out and incrementally support grassroots ECD operators ECD champions to improve and provide expanded and quality or better quality service to young children in a way that no other initiative in the country has done. It may not be perfect. We'd like it to be a bigger scale and the various problems that are preventing scale from happening that I've talked about. But the basic principle of being proactive and reaching out and not waiting for someone else to do it, government or anyone else, and recognizing that the biggest asset an opportunity in ECD is the operators on the ground, most of which are amazing women, but there are some men too. That is ECD in South Africa. That is who is looking after children. These are the people who are managing to do a job of early learning and care with the most incredibly strained resources and in the most difficult circumstances. So the smart start model understands that that's what you need to do. All the technical parts of it and the regulatory parts of it and the regulation and the standards, those things still matter. But the real key to success in ECD is operators who've got the real commitment, the real drive, who really And if you can find those people and support them, you can change ECD in South Africa. And Smart Start model understands that. And I think that is why it's principally why it's effective.

52:41 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you again. Thank you again for your time. Thank you for your insight. Very interesting as well. But you said, If before we print out anything where you are quoted, you would like to Read it before it's actually published. I've made a note of that and we will be in contact.

53:11 - Mark Misselhorn
I'm not going to rewrite what you do. I'll just want to check and make sure nothing is out of context. Whether it's a quote or whether it's about PPT, unless it's facts that you know, like PPT has done and you guys have got all that data. Obviously, those are facts, but if it's about our experience as PPT or what I said about our experience as a franchise, just ask them to bounce it off me so I can check it just to make sure that I'm comfortable.

53:43 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, no problem. Thank you so much for your time. I will definitely do that.

53:47 - Mark Misselhorn
And then the transcript, will there be a transcript of this?

53:53 - vule Tshvhs
Would you like me to email it to you now?

53:55 - Mark Misselhorn
Yeah, it's nice to have it because sometimes in these discussions you reflect on things in a way that is useful also for us to look back on. And share it with me in the transcript. Transcript's the best.

54:10 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, I'll do that.

54:11 - Mark Misselhorn
I'll send you the transcript. That'd be cool. Okay, thank you so much.

54:15 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you. Have a nice day.

54:17 - Unidentified Speaker
Nice meeting with you. You too, bye.

54:19 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, bye.





Smartstart 10-Year Report Interview: Franchisor Perspectives
The interview will be attended by representatives from Knysna Education Trust. Will speak to Nella Gysman and it was initially scheduled for Monday, 26 Jan 2026 at 9am and Auxeira consultants requested time change. Contact details: ecdreg-manager@knysnaedutrust.co.za , 073 617 7729

Fri, Jan 30, 2026
0:07 - vule Tshvhs
I know that you are Nella. Am I pronouncing it correctly? Nella. Nella, yes. Yes. Okay. I work with a company called Auxeira. We have been commissioned to write the tenure Report for Smartstart. Okay. And we want to hear more about your experience working with Smartstart. Everything from the past to maybe your anticipations about the future in working with Smartstart. But I want you to be as free as possible, relaxed, share as much as you can. Want your question clarified, I am more than willing to do that, okay? Okay. Are you ready?
0:53 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, I am.
0:55 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, I just wanted to say that this session is also being recorded for Report writing purposes. Are you okay with that?
1:02 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, yes, yes. That's fine.
1:04 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. Um, thank you. Um, so just to start off, uh, on the background, um, can you take me back to when you first became a Smartstart Franchisor? What was happening in your context at the time and what made you decide to join our organization?
1:25 - Nella Gysman
started to talk about Smartstart during COVID. I think it was around Not really 2020, but 2021 definitely. There was obviously this fear that a lot of ECD centres would close, looking at COVID and the effect that it has on everybody. So, the organisation started talk about it and then we also did some research in sort of thinking what would the community benefit if we join or have a relationship or collaboration with Smartstart of course. And I think the main thing was at the time creating a space where ECD teachers can still feel safe even though they're looking at closure perhaps or they're looking at the context of ECD in the time. And what worked in our favour was that National Education Trust also formed partnership with the Rotary International. And Rotary International sort of said to us, let's look at this problem and put a plan together. So if there would be ECDs closing at the time, what can be a solution? And Smartstart is about giving access and obviously creating opportunity and through all those discussions the organization started to talk and that formed a relationship and an agreement at the time. And obviously we did community mapping because in the past anybody can open a preschool of course and our office got to hear about it because we also have a registration department in our office. So, obviously, when someone has six and more children, we sort of work with that person. So, we did community mapping and finding that, yes, there's areas that's quite populated and there's lots of preschools, but there's other areas been identified that, you know, is not as populated and has a need. And also based on that, we joined with Smartstart to give those people opportunity to start with the Smartstart on the Smartstart program as a franchisee. And also, I think there was this belief with people that if you have a preschool, you should have a proper brick building. People weren't aware about the different modalities within ECD in giving children the opportunity. And I think Smartstart brought awareness to that in our community, that even you have space in your garage or in a church maybe. I think churches was used before, but not as much. Um, and even if you have, you know, some space at your house itself and you can accommodate children, obviously it's people who wants to do it. So we did a lot of awareness within that first Year. Um, you know, we had expos where we just went and made the community aware about it. And then through that, you know, we sort of just evolved. I wasn't personally part of Smartstart back then. I was at the organization. And another colleague of mine was the PL. And then another colleague was the coach. And both of them left at the end of 2022. And then I joined in 2023, obviously not knowing everything about Smart I can tell you up to now, I still don't know everything about Smartstart. Because Smartstart is very developmental, if I may put it like that. It's not like you know everything now at this point, and you're going to know it for the rest of this Year. You know, they review stuff, and they change things here and there, because obviously, and that's how the machine works. You know, you can't just have it, and it is what it is. So yeah.
5:31 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, thank you. Thank you so much for that. You said you started working with Smartstart personally in 2023. Yes. So I want to know from your perspective, what was it like in practice working with Smartstart?
5:52 - Unidentified Speaker
From when I started?
5:53 - vule Tshvhs
Yes. What was it like in practice? What turned out to be harder than expected and what surprised you? But I also want you to maybe reflect back on maybe other people who were there the first Year? Did they share anything of how it was like in practice?
6:13 - Nella Gysman
Yes, they did share because obviously we sit in staff meetings and we Report on all the programs. I must be honest, at the time I couldn't make sense of all the things that you know, Andile Lenay, because Andile was the coach at the time, because you know, we weren't all trained at the time and Smartstarters using their own language, if I may put it like that. So I didn't, you know, get it all at the time, but I could see that there was this initiative to create access that was, you know, we would all see that and there was times that we even joined in on the expos. We would maybe have an expo from the whole organization with all the programs that nice trust provide. And then Smartstart also has a slot. And then obviously you get to hear about it more and more, but I didn't get the full picture, to be honest with you. But I must say that the previous coach, she did a lot of going into the community, making sure that, you know, the community is aware of Smartstart. So there was great, you know, community I must say.
7:27 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, now we move on to impact, right? Can you describe a moment when you realized this work was making a real difference for children, practitioners, or communities?
7:49 - Nella Gysman
I don't have specific moments, but what I know is that it definitely created opportunities. You know, within our communities, there are areas that is always getting services, if I may put it like that. But then there are in the community itself, also other small little areas like farm areas that are a little bit neglected because they far out. So they're not getting the service. And what Smartstart really did was to take it to those people. Smartstart made sure that, you know, we've got sort of a farm area not too far from Nice now, but it's not like it's a nice road getting there. But Smartstart would take all those difficult roads and get to those communities, make those parents aware. And I also think that besides the fact that Smartstart gave opportunity for children, it was also bringing opportunity for women within the community. Because there's people that you know, had maybe a previous job and was retrenched during COVID and just has lost hope. And then Smartstart came their way. And it's, it was always there that they wanted to work with children, but maybe they never knew what needs to get done, or they never had the tools. And I think Smartstart also brought tools to people to say it is possible. You don't have to, you don't need a big brick building, you can actually do it from the space where you're at, obviously within the requirements from the Children's Act. And yeah, so I really feel that the impact that has been made was access to children within areas that was not really touched, and also opportunity to women in the community.
9:36 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, thank you. Thank you for that. Again, I want to just also reflect back on maybe what you've heard when you came in in 2023, Smartstart describes franchises as leaders who helped shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how Smartstart works today?
10:09 - Nella Gysman
What worked in our Favour a little bit is nice the education trust has been operating since 1993. So they are known in the community and I think with all the ECD work has got good relationships with people and that's now not just community people but also local government. And it made it a bit easier to come with something new like Smartstart because it is almost that we've got the trust from the people And it's not something new. I think it would have been different if Smartstart moved into this area and presented themselves to the community and the community not knowing them. So it was really in our Favour that the organization has been existing for so long and have gained trust within the community. So that was in our Favour. But yeah, there was many people that have heard about Smartstart the time and would come to our office and say, I want to start a preschool, I've heard about Smartstart, what do I need to do to join? So in 2023, at the beginning of the Year, we had many of those. But I must also say, not being part of Smartstart the previous two years, and just hearing, it was a completely different thing in 2023 when I became an employee. Because then, you It was a whole different ballgame. I needed to understand. And I felt lost. I must be saying that. I felt very lost. I didn't know whether I was coming or going. I was strained, and I was sitting in meetings. And at some meetings, I just looked, and then I think, you know, I'm part of the meeting, but I don't know. I don't know where to put the dots, really. It took me a while to put the dots together and to sort of understand, oh, OK, this is, you know, It really took me a while. It's not something that happened quickly.
12:11 - vule Tshvhs
You mentioned that the National Community Trust had already a reputation. They were known in the community. But I would like for you to reflect back maybe to maybe the introduction of Smartstart into the community.
12:37 - Unidentified Speaker
I've lost you a little bit, I don't know if it's internet.
12:40 - vule Tshvhs
It's probably the internet, I'm sorry about that. So we were reflecting back on the fact that the Knysna Community Trust is known in the community, but I would like for you to reflect back on on specifically the concept of Smartstart, right? Maybe from what maybe you can remember or what people previously have shared with you within your franchise. Much of Smartstart's reach came from franchises opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your community? Maybe let's reflect on the infrastructure of Smartstart into the community.
13:28 - Nella Gysman
At the beginning I remember we went to these communities and brought it to the community to say that we have joined Smartstart and Smartstart is all about giving children access to quality learning of course and we know the fear that goes with that because maybe there's someone that would like to work with children but don't know how to And Smartstart is one of the programs that I think can accommodate someone who doesn't even have a metric because it doesn't take rocket science to learn actually how to keep six children safe as well as having a program where you stimulate children and get them ready for proper preschool or maybe for primary school. So I think that was line because there was a lot of fear at the time and also you know people have heard that this is how it should be but we also did a mind shift within the people to say that yes that's what we've heard but government has realized not all the brick buildings can accommodate the children and there's children in the street so what are we going to do to get those kids off the streets get them safe and also stimulated and ready for school. So we sort of had to do a mind shift within the people so that they understand there's different ways of doing this and I will be equipped to do it and I don't need a degree. So that was a big thing just to get people to understand you don't need a degree, we're not looking for a fancy building and you are not doing only for yourself, but you're doing it for your community. So that was the sort of shift that we did at the very initial stage and at the beginning. And I think we have made good progress in that, I must say. I can't hear you again.
15:35 - vule Tshvhs
Sorry, sorry. Reflecting on practitioners, thinking about the practitioners you specifically support, how have you seen them change over time professionally or personally?
15:51 - Nella Gysman
We have a mixture of people that have started purely as a Smartstart franchisee, and also we've got Smartstart classes within an existing ECD. So obviously within the existing ECD, they've been exposed to of other trainings, and they've had some establishment, if I could say it like that. But for the people that have started off new as a franchisee, I think there's lots of testimonies that would come out where people say they always wanted to do this, but never had the courage. And the coach came around, and it's almost that I had the hope In my hand, but the coach came and said let's open your hand and she walked with you Opening your hand until that light is actually there um, so there's beautiful testimonies that came from individuals, especially people that have started off as a pure Smartstarter not the people necessarily that is having a classroom at an existing site because it's almost As if the site is already there. It's been established. Some of the people might be registered and funded, so there's already a pathway. But for the people that have started new, there's a different testimony to that, yes.
17:15 - vule Tshvhs
You mentioned testimonies. Is there a specific practitioner story you'd like to share? You don't have to mention names.
17:24 - Nella Gysman
We had the Smartstart Unite last Year, and I think it was a beautiful event. And if I may recommend to Smartstart, I would recommend that they actually continue with that because it was really bringing people together and it wasn't If I may put it just bluntly it wasn't people high up It was the people on the ground that got together with the same challenges and the same Testimonies and that was the most beautiful thing to me and there's one particular lady and I mean she's on video also And she said that, you know, she was an assistant previously in a private preschool. And obviously being an assistant, you can be an assistant forever and ever in a private preschool because you might not meet the requirements. And she always had this thing that she wanted to start her own thing, but she was not aware of what is needed and what are the steps. And she said Smartstart came and Smartstart gave her that. Reassurance that you're not doing this on your own. We will walk with you. And this is how we should do it. And I mean, I can't say it exactly how she does, but she has got a great testimony. And many others, of course, but particularly her.
18:44 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that. Challenges. Before we move on to challenges, let's reflect on children and families. Can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?
19:03 - Nella Gysman
Sorry, I didn't get that question.
19:05 - vule Tshvhs
Can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?
19:16 - Nella Gysman
Sorry, I'm downstairs to a building and it's a wooden floor. I don't know what the person upstairs is doing.
19:24 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, I'll be a little louder. Can you share one story of a child or a family that captures why this work matters?
19:37 - Unidentified Speaker
Oh, okay. Why Smartstart work matters?
19:40 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah, to children and families.
19:43 - Nella Gysman
Yes. Within this sector, you might set up or you might become a franchisee thinking that you're just a teacher and you will create opportunities for children. But I think it's a package because you are accommodating children with lots of other challenges, maybe social challenges. And I remember this one time, and I've got Zonke sitting on the side of me and she can correct me if I'm wrong. There was a time that they visited the franchisee and there was a child at this franchisee that was just left by the dad. I think the mom was in a different province and the dad was in the Western Cape and he brought the child to the franchisee and left the child there. So immediately that mother or that franchisee became the place of safety because it's the only person now in that situation that the child feels safe with. But also legally we understand you can't just keep a child. So I think in terms of families, our franchisees has also created a safe space for children, not only safe in the building is safe, but safe in the sense if there's any socioeconomic problems or whatever social problems there is, they've also created that for families and they've referred families to the right people like Child Welfare or the BADISAS. So besides just running a preschool and or running a franchisee, and assisting children with the program of Smartstart, you've also created other avenues and refer people, especially when you've heard maybe that there's some sort of abuse. Our franchisees get trained on the Form 22 to Report it, even if they just have that gut feeling that something is wrong. So in terms of families, I think we've really created a space where you can refer children or families, whether it's for counselling or whether it's for assistance. Whatever it may be. So yeah, that's also another avenue that it also take indirectly.
21:51 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you. Thank you for that. And we're moving on to some of the hidden challenges. What is the hardest part of being a Franchisor that people outside of a Smartstart?
22:07 - Nella Gysman
I've lost you a little bit again. So sorry.
22:11 - vule Tshvhs
What is the hardest part of being a Franchisor that people outside Smartstart often don't see or understand?
22:24 - Nella Gysman
A Franchisor like us, like National Education Trust? Yes. You know what, at the beginning, I think the existing preschools didn't fully understand the concept of Smartstart. And it was almost as if the organization they trusted so long has now brought in competition for them. Because how can you now go and associate yourself with an organization that brings competition instead of maybe referring children or parents to our preschool? So that was something that we had to deal with. And I think Being an organization that does have a learning program, and like I said, being in the area for so long, a lot of people struggled. Why the relationship with Smartstart? Is it not something that you're anyway doing? But they didn't see the difference and the impact that Smartstart can make with the collaboration. I think that was the difficult part for us. But we assured our people, the principals that we work with, that this is not competition. It's actually to help. And to help you, because in many cases, maybe in your street, you're the only preschool, and the parents obviously trust and believe in you, but you don't have the space to capacitate all those children. So Smartstart is bringing an opportunity for maybe someone else at the end of that street to also start a similar business like you, and you can actually work together where you refer parents to that other Centre. So that was the challenges that we encountered at the beginning. I must say.
24:06 - vule Tshvhs
And what support is still missing?
24:10 - Unidentified Speaker
From Smartstart or from WUNA?
24:13 - vule Tshvhs
From, let's say, Smartstart.
24:17 - Nella Gysman
Or generally.
24:18 - Unidentified Speaker
Or general support.
24:21 - Nella Gysman
I wouldn't say to the organisation itself, but I would say that it is all very good to start the setting And obviously, part of being converted, you get a stipend of for 18 to 24 months. But some of the franchisees cannot cope with only 550 rand to have a sustainable business, if I may put it like that. So I would say that since nutrition is an important thing at the, you know, working with children. Can Smartstart maybe look at that also? And is there some assurance where we give more sustainable training to people so that, you know, beyond the 18 or months that there's hope for this person to carry on without, because we're also working with people that get dependent on something like the SASSA grant or the 350 grant or whatever, we get so dependent. And when it's taken away from us, we kind of lost and we don't know how to cope. So I would say if in the future, Smartstart can maybe think about nutrition number one. And also, obviously not for everybody, because it's not a one shoe fits everyone. But in the areas and having, you know, done research and understand the community, like in some instance, is nice, is fortunate, it's very serviced, but then there's other areas like Beaufort West that we're also working in that is not as fortunate and there's not lots of businesses so there's not a lot of opportunities and fundraising is not really a solution because it's the same people that cannot afford to pay school fees that you're going to do the fundraising for. So what are that Smartstart can put in place to sustain these people and also to make a real difference, not just for the children but ultimately it will actually go down to the kids if the centre is a sustainable centre.
26:41 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, now let's reflect on early learning. What have you learned over the past 10 years? About early learning, communities, leadership or yourself?
27:01 - Nella Gysman
What have we learned? I don't think I've got your question completely, sorry.
27:09 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, what have you learned over the past 10 years about early learning? Reflecting on communities, leadership or yourself, what have you learned?
27:26 - Nella Gysman
I've definitely learned that early learning is important, early intervention is far more important as well because the earlier you work with young children and maybe there's a learning barrier or whatever challenge and you pick it up, there is greater success if it's been dealt with at in very early stage. And I think the mind shift that has also been made within the community is that many people, maybe 10 years ago, didn't fully understand the importance of early learning, because it could be someone like me who's never attended an early learning Centre. I went to primary school at the age of five. So and I did, I did well in grade one in that, you know, in those years, it was sub A, of course, So it's a complete mind shift to a person like me, who've never been in a preschool, doesn't really understand the benefits of preschool, and yet I did okay in my first Year in primary school. So I think that was the biggest learning and the impact that we've made to get people to understand. And it's tough because being a mom also, it's not always the easiest thing to actually send your child to a Centre younger than two, because it's still a baby. And we want to hang on to them. Or we feel that it's actually best that they rather stay with Gogo at home than sending them out to a preschool, expose them to other children. And at some stage, as a young mother, you see other children as a whole of the germs. But I think it's a complete mind and mind shift and the benefits because say for instance it's the only child at home there's so many things that that child learn in an early learning Centre about sharing and not everything is mine and I need to wait my turn and it comes down to emotional development because at the end of the day if that only child never went to a preschool and straight went to a primary school I think we would have you know emotional challenges because there's certain things that you do not learn at home if you're the only child. You would get everything on your time because you're the only person everybody faff on. And besides that there's small learnings that happen in early learning and it's not about one plus one or you know how to Read. There's very small things that that children learn and people take it for granted. Like I mentioned now the share And I've mentioned waiting my turn. There's small little steps that we take to actually instil the values within children from a very young age. So those are the kind of learnings. And on this question, I can actually carry on and on and on. But I think the pre-skills, the pre-skills to get children to actually get to grade one and be ready and be confident and independent children, that is what ECD does. Yes.
30:34 - vule Tshvhs
And on learning around community and leadership, what have you learned on community and leadership?
30:44 - Nella Gysman
I've definitely learned that you cannot be an island. You have to do things with other people. And at some point, you get to difficult meetings because you get people who argue about this idea that you bring about. Know, talk about. But to just be persistent, you know, and believe in what you say and what you do. And just be out there, network with other people, especially local government. There's times when we go to these IDP meetings at the municipalities, and it's frustrating at times, because there's a lot of infrastructure problems within our communities. And when it's an IDP meeting, people talk about housing, people talk about service delivery, and yet we want to come in and do advocating for ECD and say, listen, is there some opportunity that you can actually make land available for ECD centres? In this area, we are highly populated and we need some land. And it takes a tough person to actually do that, where else you understand how important it is to fight for housing. Because sometimes you have to sort of sit back ask yourself is this worth having the fight for an ECD while there is so many people not having houses. So it becomes tough at times but I think the more we say it the more people see that it's important because sometimes you would get to communities where they do long-term planning on primary and high schools but yet you do not find them making long-term planning for early learning and then they would come back and say this is a full ward with between people to 6,000 people and within 10 years it will grow into this and they need a primary school but yet you do not find them saying within two years there's going to be so many people and they need an early learning space. So those are the kind of challenges but also you know we need to just be persistent and talk about it, make government aware, make other stakeholders Away and get our word out to churches also, so I would say network Working with people as difficult as it is You know that is our way to go And have you had anything that you had to unlearn? Yes, let me say this and I'm gonna be honest with you Like previously I said working at nice education trust just believing in the program that NICE Education Trust presents and implement, I had to adapt to Smartstart’s program. I had to learn to accept the program and also believe in it. And I really think before you can become an ambassador for anything, you have to start accepting it yourself and believe in it. And that was a tough one for me, to be honest, at times felt that, why are we taking on something else while we have something in place? But I had to sort of see, you know, the differences and also how we can scale it. But that was a difficult one, because I mean, I'm part of the organization for quite some time, and being a facilitator, facilitating the program, and working with our teachers, it was almost that I had to get to a point where I start believing in a different pathway. And sometimes we have these pathways in our brain, and it's difficult to sort of, you know, adapt to another pathway to also get to the same outcome. That was a challenge for me. But I must honestly say, I've grown into accepting it, and also seeing what benefit it can make, not to everybody, but to the people who really needs it.
34:42 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that. When you look back over the decade, what makes you most proud of your role in Smartstart?
34:59 - Nella Gysman
Get to all the gatherings in Joburg with Smartstart. Yes, it's an amazing gathering. It's a whole lot of people believing in one thing and I promise you it's just an amazing thing that has you know within ECD you can at times also feel very lonely and being in our municipality we ride at the border between the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape so you're kind of right at the end of the Western Cape and you can feel lonely and you can feel on your own but I'm telling you Getting to Jo'burg and meeting all the people right across South Africa with the same kind of energy. I will never ever forget those. That is really the most amazing thing for me. And also learning from people and get to know that people are having the same challenges as you. Because obviously you find yourself within a challenge or a problem and you think this is the biggest problem in the world. I'm the only person dealing with this. And then you get to other people and you get to know No, there's actually worse things other people deal with and just the courage that people have and not every challenge has got a solution within that room But the courage that people bring, you know to you I just sort of really boost you and when you get away from those gatherings It's almost that you went there as an empty car and you've been filled up with petrol to just move on Even though you know, it's not gonna be perfect. It's gonna be challenges. I might have all the solutions, but I've got the courage, I've got the strength, and I believe in what I do.
36:39 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah, that's a very nice reflection.
36:44 - Unidentified Speaker
It's an amazing thing that I will never forget, I promise you.
36:48 - vule Tshvhs
And looking ahead, as Smartstart looks forward toward the next decade, what do you think franchises will need in order to succeed at an even greater scale?
37:04 - Nella Gysman
I think really looking at the sustainability of franchisees is one big thing and maybe if smart staff can, I know that you know there's people who sit all the time and review the strategy but if they can sort of sit down and really do proper research and of especially after the 10 years now and now I know that Smartstart is talking about scaling but with that scaling are there a few other avenues that we can open to actually really show impact and have great you know results and it's not about just number of people and number of children but how many people have sustained and stayed within the program and you know we've we've taken them from, I can almost say, feeling like a nobody to someone that feels like somebody, and we're now taking them to a point that they know they are the everybody within that community. You know, being the Centre, get to know, and people can come to you for help and reference, and you are creating a space the people that you employed also feel this is where I want to be because you know we are at a sustainable place. I think sustainability.
38:32 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah, okay our last question. Inyo, if you could say one thing to South Africa about what Smartstart has achieved, what would it be?
38:47 - Nella Gysman
I think Smartstart has achieved being resilient. Because prior to Smartstart, there was this belief, like I previously said, on ECD. And the CEO of Smartstart said it once, and it was so powerful when she said, Smartstart came to disrupt. Because, and also to disrupt, it's not an easy thing. You need to be a tough person, but you need to know why you're disrupting. And I believe that with that disruption, we open government eyes, and we also have doubt to open the community eyes and to think wider, not to only think that this is what ECD is like, and if it's not this, then it's wrong, but rather to see the bigger picture. And I think that Smartstart has really managed to do. And they've also convinced government that government need them. Not as much as Smartstart needs government, but government needs Smartstart because without what Smartstart does, government is not going to get to the point where they can say so many grade fours has actually passed and so many grade threes are ready to move to the next phase. They've And I think Smartstart can build on that and it can actually become a worldwide project or initiative.
40:23 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you so much. Thank you so much for being so insightful and sharing your perspective. We value it deeply. Can I just request or ask that Maybe we, if we do decide to use your name, or if we are to quote some of the things that you've shared with us, we use your name, not just their name, just your name. I don't mind. Okay. And also if you can, if you can, uh, we would love a photo of you. Like maybe if you have like a professional photo that we can add onto the Report, if you don't mind. You can email it back to the same email address that sent the invite.
41:11 - Unidentified Speaker
No problem. I would give everything to do a dress up.
41:16 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you to you as well. Enjoy the rest of your day.
41:22 - Unidentified Speaker
You too.
41:23 - Unidentified Speaker
Bye bye.






Date: Fri, Jan 30, 2026
 Interviewer: Thabisile Zuma
 Interviewee: Nobuhle Hlombe (LETCEE / Greytown context referenced)
Nobuhle Hlombe, Franchisor: Greytown, KZN
1. Joining the journey
Thabisile Zuma: "Take me back to when you first became a SmartStart franchisor. What was happening in your context at the time and what made you decide to join?"
 Probe if needed: What alternatives did you consider? What concerns did you have?
Nobuhle Hlombe: 
I do have a brief history that I can share. It’s not perfect, but it’s what I know.
Letcee was part of the first organisations—part of the team—that assisted in creating the SmartStart model. I believe this was because of the experience we had in playgroups, because we had been doing that for years before the SmartStart model existed. We were also using informally trained women from those particular communities to run our playgroups.
So it’s the experience that we brought into the team, and also the lessons we had learned that we felt could be shared to help create the SmartStart model. We already had a commitment to children before SmartStart came into being. We wanted to create access to early learning in disadvantaged communities, and to make sure children are school-ready.
We were also excited to be part of a bigger initiative—the SmartStart model—as a national initiative. We were keen to join because of that bigger vision and because we would be able to reach more children.
2. Early reality
Thabisile Zuma: "What were the first 6-12 months like in practice? What turned out to be harder than you expected? What surprised you?"
 Probe if needed: Was there a moment you thought, 'This might not work'?
Nobuhle Hlombe: I would be lying if I said I know. No, I don’t know.
Thabisile Zuma: Okay, and then maybe just reflect on your experience over the past three years as a Smart Start project lead. What are some of the hardships you've experienced or things that were surprising to you? Just your own reflection with the benefits of the three years.
Nobuhle Hlombe: In the past three years, I think the things that have worked—for me personally and for the partnership between LETCEE and SmartStart—are the shared purpose. We both have a commitment to children and to providing access to quality early learning. That is our common ground. No matter what happens, we are able to find each other because we have something in common.
We also have clarity of roles. It’s clearly defined what the franchisee does, what the hub does, what I do as a programme lead, what the coaches do, and what the franchisees do. That clarity has helped each person to do what they are meant to do.
I also think the partnership was strategic because of strengths—what SmartStart brings, what we bring, and how the two come together to create something bigger than ourselves.
Another key thing is consistent communication. Even when conversations are difficult or uncomfortable, we still need to show up. I need to keep showing up because what brought us together is bigger than ourselves. Communication is continuous—you can’t ever say, “We’ve got it.” Difficult issues will come up again, but you choose to show up and share respectfully so the work continues.
This applies not only between franchisor and SmartStart, but also to me as a programme lead with my team. It has a domino effect. If consistent communication is present across role players, then we are able to do what we need to do.
I also think building relationships is important—not seeing each other as “what can I get from you” but focusing on relationship. That builds trust, listening, and engagement before rushing to outcomes. Challenges will always come up, so relationship-building must continue.
Lastly, stakeholder buy-in is important. If we don’t have buy-in, it feels like competition, with organisations in separate pockets. But if we break barriers and come together, we reach more ground together than individually. SmartStart’s reach is possible because of partnerships and stakeholders—SmartStart alone could not have covered the ground it has without those partnerships.
3. Seeing impact
Thabisile Zuma: "Can you describe a moment when you realised this work was making a real difference for children, practitioners, or communities?"
 Probe if needed: What changed before and after that moment?
Nobuhle Hlombe: Firstly, as a franchisor, I see the thousands and thousands of children we are able to reach through the programme. That means thousands now have access to quality education. Their early learning journeys have been strengthened, they are made school-ready, and their trajectory has changed because of that one mama who puts up her hand and says she is willing to do it.
Secondly, I see the hundreds of women who have been empowered, equipped, and trained across communities—not only in the ECD space but as individuals. We have been able to impact their lives.
And thirdly, SmartStart has created employment for us. It allows us and our families to participate meaningfully in the economy of our country. We participate at different levels, and we cannot take that for granted or pretend it hasn’t changed our lives.
4. Shaping the platform
Thabisile Zuma: "SmartStart describes franchisors as leaders who helped shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how SmartStart works today?"
 Probe if needed: Something you questioned, adapted, or improved?
Nobuhle Hlombe: I think it has. When I look back to when I came in and where we are now in terms of relationship, I believe it is because of communication—listening to each other and giving each other space.
We operate in different contexts. Even though it’s one SmartStart model, we work in different realities. So I think one key influence is that SmartStart has shifted away from using a blanket approach. SmartStart now wants to understand where each franchisor is and meet them there.
5. Entry into communities
Thabisile Zuma: "Much of SmartStart's reach came from franchisors opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?"
 Probe if needed: Who did you have to convince? What mattered most?
Nobuhle Hlombe: We call it community engagement. That’s the initial stage where we build relationships with stakeholders. It is not a microwave process—it takes time. It involves consistent communication and presenting the SmartStart model to stakeholders.
We also want to understand what other sister organisations are doing in that municipality or district so we don’t step on each other’s toes. Many times people feel threatened, like you are coming to take over. So it’s important to create space and coordinate.
For example, in uThukela we have meetings led by the Department of Education. These bring organisations together under one roof. We engage as sister organisations alongside the department. We share what each organisation does, and we look for ways to collaborate—for example, joining hands so that one organisation can support another during school holidays through training and capacitation.
This approach works well, even though there is still resistance from some organisations who want to acknowledge you but not allow you further. So trust-building means attending stakeholder meetings, having personal relationships with stakeholders, and continuously communicating beyond formal structures.
6. Practitioners' growth
Thabisile Zuma: "Thinking about the practitioners you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally or personally?"
 Probe if needed: A specific practitioner story?
Nobuhle Hlombe: One thing I would say is confidence. It’s not something you can measure, but you can see it and experience it. It is pride in knowing they contribute to a greater good—children.
I also see sacrifice. We work deep in communities. When stipends have ended and there are no parent fees—because poverty is high and employment is low—parents cannot afford fees or do not prioritise them. But practitioners will still bring food from home so children can eat in the morning. They go beyond the call of duty to make sure children come to the playgroup and at least get a meal.
I also see how being able to participate in the economy matters. Someone might say R500 is small, but to someone earning that, it changes their life.
7. Children and families
Thabisile Zuma: "Can you share one story of a child or family that captures why this work matters?"
 Probe if needed: What stands out about that story for you?
Nobuhle Hlombe: (No specific child/family story was shared in this interview segment.)
8. Hidden challenges
Thabisile Zuma: "What is the hardest part of being a franchisor that people outside SmartStart often don't see or understand?"
 Probe if needed: What support is still missing?
Nobuhle Hlombe: The hardest part is that we plan and we have ideas, but the reality on the ground is different. Dynamics in communities continuously change, and we need to adapt because we work with communities.
Sometimes it looks like we are not doing what we are supposed to be doing. For example, in the implementation plan (IP), we might have said by February we would have done certain things, but changes on the ground influence implementation.
So we struggle with implementation plans not being flexible enough to accommodate changes that happen in communities. We still need to deliver, but we are also constantly adapting to changing conditions.
Probe: What support is still missing?
Thabisile Zuma: And then can you just reflect a little bit about what are some of like the contextual difficulties and maybe what support you think might be missing or just in thinking about the future what support could really be helpful?
Nobuhle Hlombe: Where we are based, demographically, areas are scattered. What coaches in Johannesburg can do compared to our coaches is very different.
So we need SmartStart not to use a blanket approach with the same expectations for everyone. Franchisees in KZN should be treated as franchisees in KZN because of demographics and context. Implementation plans should be adjusted based on where we work, so that we can still be impactful.
9. Learning over time
Thabisile Zuma: "What have you learned over the past 10 years about early learning, communities, leadership, or yourself?"
 Probe if needed: Something you had to unlearn?
Nobuhle Hlombe: Let me start with communities. I’ve learned it is important for us to adapt. Communities are different, and what works for one community will not work for another. So we should not use a blanket approach when we enter and work in communities.
Communities have different structures—some have amakhosi, some have indunas, some have councillors—so adaptation is important.
I’ve also learned the power of partnerships with key stakeholders. Partnerships extend reach, increase impact, and also create accountability. In the SmartStart network, for example, I have a circle of programme leads that I communicate with, and it creates accountability as a leader.
In early learning, I’ve learned it is a privilege to offer these services to underprivileged children. It changes their whole journey. When they get to Grade 1, they can be on the same footing as other children regardless of background—whether they are raised by a grandmother, whether their mother is a cleaner, whether they are an orphan. It gives them equal opportunity.
About myself: leading people means treating them the way I want to be treated. I don’t believe people resist change—they resist not being included, not being seen, not being valued.
Leadership requires sacrifice. Sometimes it’s beyond work. For example, if a coach’s child is sick, I must check in and support them as a person so that they can be effective. This work requires patience—we won’t see results immediately. It takes commitment and continuously showing up.
10. Pride
Thabisile Zuma: "When you look back over the decade, what makes you most proud of your role in SmartStart?"
Nobuhle Hlombe: I’m proud of the impact in the lives of children—that we are able to change their life stories.
I’m also proud of the impact of being given a role to play. Sometimes you don’t believe in yourself at first, but someone says, “It’s you I want. We believe you can do it.” Then you gain confidence because someone believes in you and walks alongside you until you can stand on your own.
I’m proud of the influence I get to share with coaches. I intentionally choose how I want to influence their character—how I show up as a leader, how I encourage them to empower and develop themselves, to do short courses, and to grow.
I also value creating safe spaces for them. Our office should be a safe space—not only a place where work is done.
11. Looking ahead
Thabisile Zuma: "As SmartStart looks toward the next decade, what do you think franchisors will need in order to succeed at even greater scale?"
Nobuhle Hlombe: It goes back to what I was saying about the blanket approach. We need to be seen as who we are in our space.
We need to meet each other and agree on what we are going to do and what we can do—what our reach can be. Then based on those realities, we can identify the resources needed to extend our reach. So it’s about being seen as franchisors in our real contexts.
12. In your own words
Thabisile Zuma: "If you could say one thing to South Africa about what SmartStart has achieved, what would it be?"
Nobuhle Hlombe: SmartStart has reached children that otherwise would not have been reached.
We go to places where no one else wants to go.
Women have been empowered. And the domino effect of this programme is not only early learning—it touches different aspects of life and different roles of people, all of which contribute to the wellbeing of the child.
Closing
Thabisile Zuma: Thank you so much. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed talking to you. I’m inspired listening to your passion and insights. I’m going to ask you for one more thing—please send me a picture that you would be comfortable having included in the report. You shared great quotes that I would love to quote exactly as you said them. I’d like permission to use the contents of this interview for compiling the report, and also a photograph of you (if available).
Nobuhle Hlombe: Thank you so much. I really appreciate you making this a safe space. I was worried. But it was enjoyable. I will send you a picture.
Thabisile Zuma: Any picture is fine. 
Nobuhle Hlombe: Okay. Thank you so much.

Interview details 
Interview topic: SmartStart 10-Year Report – Franchisor Perspectives
Purpose: To document franchisors’ lived experiences, learning, challenges, and contributions to SmartStart over its first decade
Interviewer: Thabisile Zuma (Auxeira commissioned to write the SmartStart 10-Year Report)
Respondent(s): Erika Hougaard (with contributions from Isabella, long-standing team member)
Date: Mon, 26 January 2026
1. Joining the journey
Question:
 “Take me back to when you first became a SmartStart franchisor. What was happening in your context at the time and what made you decide to join?”
Response:
 SmartStart became part of our journey in 2016, following conversations between SmartStart and the Dutch Reformed and Uniting Reformed Churches through a service group called Diaconia. At the time, the churches were reflecting deeply on how to respond meaningfully to poverty and inequality, and early childhood development emerged as the most strategic intervention.
After exposure to the Heckman Curve and the return on investment in ECD at a General Synod meeting, ECD was adopted as one of the church’s priority focus areas. Church leaders then travelled extensively across the country looking for a curriculum and approach that aligned with their values and context.
SmartStart stood out because it was not just about a curriculum. It offered a practical, scalable model that could work in small towns and remote areas, where churches already had a presence. This led to Diaconia, later Little Seeds, becoming SmartStart’s first faith-based franchisor. Over time, BADISA, the churches’ social services organisation, also aligned its ECD work, leading to the establishment of a dedicated ECD unit. The motivation throughout was to move beyond charity and instead walk alongside communities in a more meaningful, dignity-affirming way.
2. Early reality
Question:
 “What were the first 6–12 months like in practice? What turned out to be harder than you expected? What surprised you?”
Response:
 The early months were characterised by both opportunity and hard, often underestimated work. While the churches gave access to a wide network, unlocking that access required extensive advocacy, relationship-building, and awareness-raising. Convincing congregations of the importance of ECD and equipping them to engage meaningfully took far more time and effort than anticipated.
One of the biggest surprises was how complex community entry proved to be. Different church contexts required different approaches, and the advocacy effort effectively doubled because the target communities were often not the same as the congregations themselves. While there was strong initial buy-in from committed individuals, programmes were vulnerable when key champions retired or passed away.
In hindsight, there were also operational mistakes. Training was sometimes offered in areas without sufficient coaching support or density, leaving a legacy of practitioners who are still difficult to reach years later due to distance and cost. These experiences highlighted that geography, density, and long-term support structures matter deeply.
At the same time, church support played a critical role in getting the work off the ground, from providing venues and storage to offering moral and logistical support. One of the most important early lessons was that there is no single model that fits every context, and flexibility is essential.
3. Seeing impact
Question:
 “Can you describe a moment when you realised this work was making a real difference for children, practitioners, or communities?”
Response:
 A defining moment came in 2019 during the filming of a SmartStart documentary. In Oudtshoorn, a SmartStart site was operating from a church’s mothers’ room. There was a young boy, Kwesi, whose mother struggled with alcoholism and who showed clear developmental delays. He could barely walk or speak.
What stood out was how the practitioner treated him no differently from the other children, encouraging and stimulating him with warmth and consistency. Over time, the progress he made was remarkable. Although SmartStart was not designed as a special-needs programme, it created conditions where this child could develop far beyond expectations. That moment made it clear that the model has value for every child.
Impact was also evident in the transformation of women practitioners. Many spoke of renewed pride and confidence, dressing professionally, identifying as business owners, and seeing themselves as capable and valued. Stories of children thriving and parents repeatedly choosing SmartStart reinforced the sense that communities trust the programme. Retention, more than numbers alone, became a powerful indicator of impact.
4. Shaping the platform
Question:
 “SmartStart describes franchisors as leaders who helped shape the platform itself. In what ways did your experience influence how SmartStart works today?”
Response:
 Our organisation grew alongside SmartStart. Through close engagement, training, and exposure to new thinking, SmartStart invested significantly in franchisors’ capacity, both organisationally and personally. The learning extended beyond theory into practical problem-solving and innovation.
Being deeply field-based, we consistently fed back what we were seeing on the ground, including challenges around density, coaching ratios, and geographic spread. This feedback was not always easy to accommodate, but there was always openness to listening. Even when immediate change was not possible, there was a sense that franchisors’ voices mattered.
Because of our smaller scale and strong quality focus, we were often used for sponsor visits, and research initiatives. This allowed SmartStart to test ideas in lower-density, more complex contexts, and contributed to broader platform learning.
5. Entry into communities
Question:
 “Much of SmartStart’s reach came from franchisors opening doors locally. How did you build trust and gain entry in your communities?”
Eesponse:
 Community entry relied heavily on existing relationships through churches and local structures, but trust still had to be earned. Coaches played a central role, particularly when they came from the communities themselves and understood local dynamics.
Where community entry was done well, coaches became highly effective advocates. Over time, municipalities began to recognise SmartStart as an extension of their own outreach work. In some areas, this led to formal partnerships, co-branding, and even access to land and infrastructure. However, these outcomes required patience and years of consistent relationship-building.
6. Practitioners’ growth
Question:
 “Thinking about the practitioners you support, how have you seen them change over time professionally or personally?”
Response:
 The growth among coaches has been substantial. Many began as inexperienced ( sometimes without Matric) coaches without formal qualifications, yet through mentoring and experience developed into confident, skilled professionals with strong facilitation and communication abilities.
Practitioners, particularly women, showed marked personal and professional transformation. As their programmes stabilised, they gained pride, confidence, and a clearer understanding of managing a business. The club system further strengthened this growth by creating peer networks that offered emotional support, shared problem-solving, and collective bargaining power within communities.
This collective identity enabled practitioners to engage more confidently with schools, sponsors, and local authorities, and reduced dependency on the franchisor for day-to-day problem-solving.
7. Hidden challenges
Question:
 “What is the hardest part of being a franchisor that people outside SmartStart often don’t see or understand?”
Response:
 One of the least visible challenges is the cost and complexity of working across vast, low-density areas. Travel, logistics, and ensuring consistent support for practitioners in remote locations require significant resources and long-term commitment.
There is also a tension between scale and depth. Smaller franchisors may never reach the numbers celebrated publicly and in the Smartstart awards, yet they often hold deep contextual knowledge and operate in the most underserved areas. This work is slow, relational, and difficult to quantify, but essential for reaching the most marginalised children.
8. Learning over time
Question:
 “What have you learned over the past 10 years about early learning, communities, leadership, or yourself?”
Response:
 Over time, it became clear that communities are profoundly unique, shaped by culture, geography, and local rhythms. Solutions that work in one province may fail in another, and respecting these differences is critical.
Leadership growth came through exposure to a broader ECD ecosystem, collaboration with other franchisors, and participation in collective initiatives such as hubs. This helped shift perceptions of our organisation from “small” to strategically important within the system.
Personally and professionally, the journey strengthened confidence, clarified organisational strengths, and reinforced the value of ecosystem thinking over isolated interventions.
9. Looking ahead
Question:
 “As SmartStart looks toward the next decade, what do you think franchisors will need in order to succeed at even greater scale?”
Response:
 Scaling will require simplification. Training has become too dense, expensive, and overwhelming for practitioners who already face significant logistical and personal pressures. To grow sustainably, SmartStart must identify the non-negotiable core of the model and streamline delivery.
Greater investment in coaches and clubs is essential, as these structures are key to sustainability and local ownership. Contextual adaptation, rather than uniform expansion, will be critical to reaching the most underserved communities without losing the essence of the SmartStart approach.
10. In your own words
Question:
 “If you could say one thing to South Africa about what SmartStart has achieved, what would it be?”
Response:
 SmartStart has demonstrated that it is possible to build a nationally recognised, trusted platform focused on one core goal: creating access for young children. Its strength lies in service, partnership, and a willingness to look beyond organisational agendas.
The fact that international audiences have been genuinely surprised that such an innovative, scalable model emerged from South Africa speaks to the significance of what has been achieved. SmartStart has shown what is possible when purpose, humility, and collaboration come together.
