1:11 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Oh, hi.

1:14 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Hi, Chris.

1:18 - Grace Matlhape
I'm good thanks, how are you?

1:20 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm good, my name is Vuledzani.

1:23 - Grace Matlhape
Pleased to meet you Vuledzani, am I saying it right?

1:28 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yes, I have been tasked with this great opportunity of interviewing you today and I look forward to the conversation and hopefully we can get it as much as we can from this Interview. Praise yourself. I said there was no time limit to how long this is going to take.

1:59 - Grace Matlhape
No, no, no, it cannot, no, it cannot be limitless at all. It's the middle of a work day. So on the dot of two o'clock I've got to go. Okay okay that's good that's that's good um so it means then then we have to be brief with um the responses we do have quite a number of questions but I feel like if we can get to the more important ones then the better they are all important but the most important ones yeah um yeah so let's it means on your side as well try and be as brief as possible because we did get a lot of that I was I was hoping that Thabo would have briefed you that that is not possible no that's that's just a hard thing I went through the questions and they are very diverse and you know some of them did not feel like the kind of thing that I want published in our annual report so maybe what would be cool is if maybe you are the one Thabo I don't know if you gave me a sense of what's the big picture, what's the big story you're trying to tell so that I understand the context for the questions you are asking me?

3:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Just going through the questions, I think it's just really looking back on leadership, upscaling and the model, the franchise or model is.

3:36 - Grace Matlhape
Okay yeah so I'll stick to those yeah because the people things you know some of the I mean I don't know whether the thing is you see I know what are some of the difficult decisions I had to take and knowing your boundaries tells me which questions you know which difficult decisions I've had to take if you just put them all out there some of the main decisions are the ones that are actually don't want to be I mean do you know what I'm saying that's that's why I needed to get that big picture okay so we're looking at the last 10 years and and just talking about the things that come to mind that I want to tell Jane public definitely yeah and if a question feels like maybe you want to limit some of that information that's also fine but I was tasked with this big mission of asking you this question.

4:43 - vuledzani Tshivhase
So briefly, just to look back at the background, take me back to the beginning. What was the founding vision for Smart Start?

4:52 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so Smart Start was an idea that was born out of three funders. Who had been funding ECD in different ways, in very different ways among the three of them, over a long period. But the funding had been directed to parts of the solution for the problems that they were focusing on. And they got to a point where they thought, you know, this is not actually connecting into sort of a progressive problem solving for a big problem in our country. I hope that makes sense. If it doesn't make sense, you have to stop me so that I can explain what I mean. And so they thought, no, we have to establish an organization among ourselves that's going to really design, understand the problem we're trying to solve and design that helps to solve that problem and close education. And so that was the big vision. The big vision was the big problem South Africa has is too many children are still excluded. We put money, but we donate to this one, donate to that one, donate to that one. We put money into this thing, but we're not solving the problem. So how could we actually look at a solution that will solve, help to close the gap in access to quality early childhood care and education.

6:36 - vuledzani Tshivhase
That is concise, that is concise. Thank you so much for that.

6:41 - Grace Matlhape
And reflecting in the first three years, okay, what was harder than you expected in the first three Yeah yeah so in the first three years one of the big assumptions was that so that the model actually was really well thought through um and you know it it took it took care of things like we want this to grow to be as a scalable model so it must already right from the beginning have the big ambition of reaching all children so that was clear and that was designed for it's not that was designed for scale right from the beginning um it was and it had designed a very affordable way of getting to many children at the same time and that affordable way was two mornings a week in play groups for as many children as we can get through these two mornings a week let me just give me a minute my window. So this is a garden service time and they start working under my window. So the things that were unexpected, first of all, the fact that two mornings a week when you feel the benefit early are unsustainable. When parents started to feel the benefit of those two mornings a week they wanted more and they were not willing to pay for less than the more they were looking for. So play groups as a model was rejected by the market. Does that make sense?

8:39 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm assuming that you understand It does, it does, it's making me reflect back on some of the smart starters I've been talking to.

8:51 - Grace Matlhape
So it does, it does. Okay, okay, cool, good. So the market rejected two mornings a week because they wanted more of what they were seeing, but also the two mornings a week were designed with what the child needs in mind. If a child can get two mornings a week, there's evidence that they will progress, they'll thrive, and we can actually achieve good outcomes for children to be ready for school. It was not necessarily designed with what the parent needs in mind. Now, we defined ourselves as an early learning organization, an early learning model, but the container of learning, you're going to have to use words that make sense, but for me to say what I'm saying, I'm using my own words. The actual vehicle that drives, that is used for early learning is usually child care. So, so when, and that is mature, you, when you look after, when you are educating zero to five year olds, it usually comes with a child care component to it. And that is what the market is used to. So, what Smart Start was trying to do was separate those two components and we were only focusing on the child education piece. The market rejected that separation because there is a huge need for child care. The parent started to say, I'm not prepared for you to take my child only for two mornings and then it doesn't free me to go seek employment. So the actual marriage between care and education was insisted upon by the market. So again, I'm assuming that you understand what I'm talking about, and if you don't, you'll ask me. So that was the surprise in the market. The third one was, was it the second or whatever, the nth one. As you can see here, what I'm talking about is supply, supply access. But we assumed that if you supply, there is latent demand that exists and that the introduction of supply will automatically attract demand. So if you bring, if you start an early learning program in this the blower. The blower is the most terrible one of the garden service systems that I can't hear myself think. So I think it's going to pass, it's going to be done just now. It's like I can hear myself screaming at you because I'm trying to hear myself.

11:50 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay go on. I cannot hear the blower but I completely understand we had earlier the same thing.

11:58 - Grace Matlhape
I can hear you. Everyone wants clean gardens during the weekend. Okay, so she's gone. So the third thing was demand. We assumed that demand will pop up just because we bring supply. We had not invested enough in understanding the nature of that demand as in it won't want two mornings. It actually, first of all, needs childcare and then can think about if of children on top of it. So those are the three things we underestimated. And it was a real surprise to me that the market refuses to settle for what you bring. The market for children really insists on choice, unless choice is completely absent. I mean, sorry, I'm being a bit abstract. I can hear myself. But those were the things that were a bit of a surprise. So as a result, we had to change the model. It became much more expensive because we had to integrate childcare into our costing. That means full-time and actually that means an idea of a centre which we had not built into the model at all. Felt like schooling, let's not call it schooling at all ever, I'm just saying it just to make sure that you and I are on the same page, and had not thought enough of the childcare component as part of it. It increased our costs tremendously and the trust and the support, the commitment to the problem by our founder investors is actually the thing that carried us because I came back to them and said, this thing is going to cost much more than the modeling that had been done in the beginning. And they did not give up. They did not move away. They did not give up on the dream. They continued to invest in helping to close the gap in access to quality early learning and innovating solutions that now take into consideration the real conditions and the circumstances in the markets, in the environments that we're trying to solve for.

14:33 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I think you also touched on my next question. You had mentioned that you had to change the model. So the next question focuses on how has Smart Start changed since 2015, and what did you get wrong initially that you've corrected? And I also want to touch on a bit so that you can just summarize what's been the hardest leadership decision that you've made in the past 10 years? Because I feel like those two points go hand in hand. So if you could just summarize that, yeah.

15:07 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, yeah. So the real, I mean, I'm going to forget the questions, actually. I'm trying to keep to your questions. So you say what were the model changes? What has changed since 2015?

15:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what have you had to correct? And some of the hardest leadership decisions that you've had to make.

15:33 - Grace Matlhape
You know, the main thing that changed is we changed from playgroups into a market driven multi model solution. So we provide a solution for early childhood care and education that that market wants, that part of the community wants. Let's not talk markets, let's talk communities. So it's driven by what parents want. If parents want to look after their own children and they just want children to be stimulated from time to time, We have a solution for that through playgroups because they still exist in some places. If parents need childcare but they want their child to be in a small group, they don't want big schools where they think children will be picking up infections, we have the day mother model that enables parents to do that. If parents really want a place where they are assured that, I don't know what, they want perhaps more the social side of early learning, they want the child to learn to play with other children, whatever, all of the components, and they want a centre, there's a model that also takes care of centres while actually delivering the quality that Smart Start delivers. So, we changed from a play group only, a supply driven approach, to multiple modalities, model that is driven by what the parents of these children require. So as I was saying, I mean, it's exactly that question I was answering. I mean, it became a really, it became a real pivot. It became a real pivot. The second thing that changed is we always assumed, I mean, and then the other thing was that demand, you know, we had thought that we're just to build, you know, run playgroups, playgroups. We had not built sustainable enterprises into the model initially. So as soon as you change the modalities, as I said, it was a real pivot. You had to start thinking about who are going to, who's going to be willing to work five days a week. Only an entrepreneur who has the courage to charge, they're building a business, they will charge for their services. The initial playgroup model was largely built on assumed partnerships with government, where public employment programs were paying stipends, like CWP, EPWP, were paying stipends to playgroup facilitators. And so parents were not paying fees actually really, but it just was not working. It was a really courageous move to change, an enterprise model where parents actually pay fees for the services that they get from the practitioner. So you have to make sure that the practitioner delivers the quality that the parents are willing to pay for and so on. The third thing, you know, I mean further down, once we understood the problem really, really well, we understood that a paying model which is similar to the rest of South Africa and even though most of our people were not paying a lot of money, what are the real drivers of exclusion of children? As we started to understand the problem we are trying to solve, the ECD challenge, we realised that we will not be able to close this gap if we don't solve the actual things that I don't know whether Villezanne is still online because you've frozen. I am. Okay, you're frozen on my screen. I don't know whether it's your connection. You keep freezing, so you make me think, but I keep looking at Thabo and Thabo looks absolutely clear, so that means it's your connection. Okay, but let's continue. So then further down, you know, another sort of significant change had to be about more than just building supply and demand, which are the things that, you know, at like five year mark, those things were mature already. We realized, okay, so we can recruit women, we can help them start businesses in ECD, they can achieve good quality child outcomes. The thing that continued to be a problem problem is that they cannot build sustainable businesses in poor conditions, in poor circumstances, in poor communities, because their parents cannot afford to pay, they cannot afford to register with government, and therefore they are unable to get government funding. And that became the problem that we needed to solve. So rather than just solving for supply and And we started having to solve for the systems, the government systems, that actually keep children out of access to quality early learning. That took us into a whole area of systems transformation, influencing policy, influencing legislation, even influencing mindsets that take those decisions. Like, just really looking at the problem from what are the causes of this problem that led us to the third part of our work, which is now a very mature partnership with governments, but also very mature advocacy partnerships with others that target the systems that perpetuate exclusion of children from ECD.

21:51 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And on the hardest decision you've had to make in the past 10 years?

22:04 - Grace Matlhape
You know, I must be honest, I think the hardest decision we're having to make is now. It has really felt like up to now we've had to just do the obvious thing, like just go with curiosity and a problem-solving mindset to where the problem takes you, and just solve that problem, move that direction, do what needs to be done, and go in the direction of the problem. That has not been difficult. At all. I mean it has its difficulties but it's not a difficult decision, you know, when you are a perpetually changing organization it has its challenges but most of the challenges are human capital challenges, they are people challenges, it's hard for people to work in an environment that is always changing, it just feels like this at some point to go through a time when it feels like there's no security because, you know, you never know what the next change is, you know, that kind of thing. But, you know, those are not hardest decisions. They are what comes with the environment we work in. You know, I certainly knew with the first generation of people who joined Smart Start that it's inevitable, you know, you've got to go in that direction. The hardest decision I think we have to make is the one that says the asset we've built and maybe that decision we took last year because it feels like we've already made that decision. We built this asset for South Africa, we knew we were building for South Africa, but we were building a brand. We wanted to create demand for quality early learning. When you create demand for quality early learning, you make sure that the person you know I mean when I mean or demand for whatever anything whatever you know quality toothpaste whatever demand for quality anything the thing that becomes important is that the brand must be must be an important tool to create the promise of that quality so that your brand becomes the verb you know like when checkers came the plastic bags at the time when we were tired of carrying things. It used to be very difficult to carry groceries. You're too young to know. It used to be very difficult to carry the groceries in brown bags. Because when you are in a township and you're in a public transport, you are holding these bags. You have to hold them like this. And it's not like that, and so on and so on. And then Czechoslovakia came with an innovation. I don't know whether there were other people who were actually before checkers but the reason why they are called checkers when it's a plastic bag and not checkers is that it was checkers who came up with a very convenient carrier bag. Do you know what I mean? And so it's the same when you are trying to, when you are changing something, your brand becomes the thing that can easily identify what quality looks like so that the demand for that actually is clear. People know that they are looking for a checkers. So our aim was you use the brand so that you know you know you make smart that you are looking for a smart start. But maybe it's not smart that they're looking for. Maybe they're just looking for any ECD center close to where they live. But what defines quality? You know what I'm saying, right? So a brand became a really important thing and we invested a lot in this brand. I mean, you know, I don't know that that investment was so much about money as it is about consistency, constant communication. You know that we don't have perfection, but we actually did invest a lot in this brand and it's a powerful, mature brand in the ECD sector in South Africa and beginning to also be visible in similar ways globally. And now the decision we have to take is letting go of the outer control of that brand and let others feel a part of the brand without losing their own identity. Now when you are a brand person, you understand how powerful brands can be in behaviour change, it's not an easy decision to take that. But it's a decision that we had to take last year I believe as Smart Start. Certainly the decision makers in Smart Start like our board and so on. We had to confront the fact that we haven't really succeeded to inspire any sort of other Smart Start type organizations in South Africa and Now we have a powerful opportunity with the Minister of Education and the President and others. You know, we saw that across all political parties, quite honestly, where they have their attention on ECD and how they can support ECD. They've supported the amendment of the legislation, new policies that are coming in, new budgets that are coming in. We can't hold on to this branch. We've got to make sure. We don't have anybody else. Nobody else is looking at new access to quality early learning in South Africa. There are a lot of fantastic ECD organisations that are working on other parts of ECD. In order to accelerate expansion of ECD, Smart Start must open up the platform, be owned at community levels. Traditional leaders lead their communities around driving accelerated expansion. Counsellors, churches at the local level. We have to open up the ability to inspire people to get involved in PCCD. And if Smart Start is no longer perfectly managed by us at the centre, let it go. I mean, some of it will be lilac, some of it will be violet, some of it will be maroon with a tint of whatever. But what's important is that it brings the awareness of the importance of early learning front and centre in communities and is a powerful tool that others could be a part of to help accelerate skills.

29:10 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I don't know, I feel like often I talk in such theoretical terms that what I'm trying to say not be completely understandable but I think I think it's understandable the analogies give a better picture so it's understandable it's just that in the details we are losing that a timeline that we have set for ourselves yeah okay no that's all right let's try let's do our best okay so now just to focus move shifting to focusing on the franchisors Why did Smartstart start to choose a franchisor led model and what makes it effective in reaching communities at scale?

29:56 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so this is one of the things that I was saying were built into the model right from the beginning because right from the beginning we knew that we were wanting to design for scale and in order to design for scale you need the franchisor in a franchisor-franchisee relationship. To be close to where the franchisee is sitting. You couldn't be a franchisor sitting in Johannesburg, which is in a particular way, and be effective as a franchisor for a franchisee sitting in Limpopo with its own unique local circumstances. So the franchisor model was meant to make sure that the support for franchisees is local, relevant but also proximate, culturally connected to the community that we're solving for. A franchise is national or global or international like a Coca-Cola, but the actual delivery of that product or service is far more local than where the decisions for the brand are taken. And so we need a first partners who approximate the problem we are trying to solve to support approximated the franchises to support them effectively because this is set for children. We needed cultural relevance so you know they speak the same language as those children. They know the context of the parents and so actually far more effective in solving. But the fourth thing, which is maybe even more important, important is in order to make sure that you can grow faster by bringing a layer of strategic partnership of NGOs throughout South Africa. So you know, so if you have 12 partners, let's just say you have nine partners and they are all each. Each province has its own partner. You already have strategic capacity in every province. Of this franchise resource is potentially another organization like yourself, it's potentially a new smart start organization you know that can actually expand through its own network of partners in that community. So in some ways think of a market, network marketing and you know it does cascade you know network marketing you know, when you sell Heba Life and then you recruit five people who are going to be there, what, what, and each one of those five people recruit their what, what, what. You know, I don't know those things, but my cousin sells Heba Life. It's a similar mindset in a social impact environment. You know, it's a cascading. So what we call it in our scale language is distributing the ability to solve the problem. So you bring this capacity we have here in Jobet, we make sure that we plant one in Limpopo, one inward, one in, so that they themselves, when they grow, they can grow deeper that way. And when you get to Manamulele, Manamulele can also grow deeper in that way and so on. So those are the four reasons why you, but there are probably many, many more advantages, but those are the four reasons. Reasons why we chose this model. And at the heart of it, it was meant to be a partnership. The partnership existed before the franchisor relationship. Those organizations partnered us in the early days when we were designing the curriculum to start off with. So each one of them knew, I mean, there were four at that time. I mean, there were more, but out of the six that we had, only four became franchisors, others stayed out of this perhaps that future so to speak at that point. So they feel like this is a co-designed solution, co-owned solution and so on and that as we grow we attract many many more so that actually that network marketing effect is realised.

34:26 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yeah, in also just trying to connect what you just spoke about now with the different partners, I think maybe to also just make up for time, what have franchises taught you about community entry and local leadership or early learning that you didn't know before?

34:48 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so I mean I can't comment about early learning, I think that that's the piece that's just hard to separate, because in fact, you know, we, okay, maybe if I think carefully, I'll just see, I'll see if I remember something, because I can, I realise that that might be, that might be short-sighted for me to say what I was just saying. Yeah, so, you know, to be honest with you, franchisors themselves are very, very diverse. Taught us many things about a few other things that you're not even asking me. You know, they come, every organization has its own core competency. So, for example, I actually feel like the biggest community entry lessons we learned did not come necessarily from a franchisor. Came from where we work as a branch, where we didn't find the right franchisor partner. So we experienced in Limpopo a massive love for the brand, receptiveness to smart start. I mean, I have to stop saying the brand, but because it's more than that. Or whatever. Anyway, so they really, really are receptive to Smart Start. And when we try to understand why, we realize that the head of the region in Smart Start, who's employed directly, not a franchisor, is actually deeply connected in the traditional leadership system. And everywhere she she's very, very careful to start with the traditional leaders. And, you know, that's sort of obvious theory, isn't it? However, what makes it special is that while in principle our community, and we always had, we had a community entry protocol nearly on day one as well. But, you know, we just, it was just generalized as community leaders. And I think in our minds, because we're sitting in the urban communities, we're thinking much more of councillors, churches, we worked hard on establishing partnerships with churches, but actually what really started to teach us important lessons is the special relationship with the traditional leadership. In Limpopo, which we then went and expanded in KZN, and it was just on steroids in KZN, And so, you know, like just that, you know, I guess the answer is just that the diversity of leadership or the influence, the nature of influence of leadership is not defined, can never be defined at the national level. It's defined locally. Who is influential? Who is the influencer? Who is influential in these communities? Because that is how that sort of translates into value for us. So the reason why I said, let me not say that franchises did not teach us about community entry. The other thing that emerged from the system maybe the role of the franchisors play the role there is where a franchise drives you to define everything the franchise when you are when you work a franchise you don't want to have to define a KFC that has a risk of coming out as what's that one that's like KFC that yellow one that the chickens are the same chicken licking the chickens are the same if they added a little bit of this and that they could there's a risk that it could come out as a chicken licking and if you're I mean let me not make these examples but I'm trying to be concrete so when you run the franchise you have to be you have to micromanage you have to define things strongly um and and so what the insights that emerged is that uh when you define too strongly you squeeze out the life out of this because in fact the power is in the franchisor's ability to take decisions that drive, that may be unique only to that context and will drive results in a unique way for that context. So our relationship with the franchisors made us realize that we actually have to loosen up on the micromanagement of the franchisors and create a platform for them to input into the mechanism so that they have room to contribute continuous improvement, particularly local relevance for themselves. I understand exactly what I'm talking about, so I'm hoping that the two of you will sit together and make sense of this because you understand exactly what I'm talking about because you can picture it. So those are some of the lessons. I mean, let's just say in the co-creation of the curriculum, in the early days, we drew on the expertise that existed among the franchisors before they were franchisors in creating content for early learning. So that is a contribution by the franchisors together with the experts we employ, people who are experts in curriculum design in early childhood development. Yeah so I think you know the kinds of lessons we learned from the franchise relationship is about you know letting go of control in order for them to accelerate their own expansion locally um and and change certain things to suit the local context in ways that we don't yet see um and uh but actually we can all learn from um you had another thing You said community entry, early learning and what?

41:31 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Local leadership. But I feel like you've touched on that as well.

41:34 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:36 - vuledzani Tshivhase
You've touched on that. Just to move on as well to impact and evidence. That's the next section. But I want to focus more maybe on systems change. The planning document talks about Smart Start as a system solution and an end-to-end delivery platform. Explain what that means in practice.

42:04 - Grace Matlhape
So I told you that at a certain point about five years ago when we were designing the strategy that we are implementing now, we realized that this is a wicked problem. It's a structural problem. It's a poverty-driven problem. And so you've got to solve the of poverty at the same time as you are solving access. Otherwise, you're just creating more inequity. If we just continue to just supply and only the ones who can afford come, we are not solving the problem. We're just shifting from one thing to the next. Sometimes you're basically bringing instability to existing ECD providers because parents just move from that provider to you. And so you're not ready solving the problem and so we designed Smartstart that it was always an end-to-end solution so when I say end-to-end solution we mean it we designed as a full journey of a new practitioner from going into a community and telling them about how powerful ECD is going to groups of women and telling them about the opportunity for them in ECD recruiting them, training them. We don't train for qualification and go and find a way. We train to convert, to implement. So we are an end-to-end in that it's a value chain. It starts with community entry recruitment and setup, which is training and coaching, all the way to registered, connected with a club, funded by government and and funded by parents. That's what end-to-end means. We're solving for every stage in the delivery system. We're solving for recruitment and knowledge and demand. We're solving for training and capacity building. We're solving for quality assurance. We're solving for sustainable businesses. We're solving for registration and compliance with government. And we're solving for retention and connected to a network. That entire end-to-end That's what we mean. And so when we say delivery platform, we're talking about the architecture that includes how we use the brand, how we partner with franchisors, how we partner with nutrition companies, how we support both quality early learning and sustainable enterprises. We're talking about the full architecture that sort of how we solve for technology, for data, for insights, for information that is then taken and is, you know, so if we didn't have a powerful data platform, we wouldn't be able to draw insights that we use to influence government policy and legislation, you know. So that's what we mean by an end-to-end delivery platform. That's what we mean.

45:05 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And looking at the data that does influence like government policy Do you have, what data gives you the most strongest evidence that Smart Start is working?

45:19 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, well I mean the first I guess is that we actually are getting women who are unemployed and those that are employed too. The brand has that, this week I was hosting a funder from Europe, we actually went to visit someone who left a job as a financial planner to do this. So it's no longer just about unemployed people who don't have a choice. The brand is really powerful and strong. It puts its own demand. And so we know by how much we've succeeded in bringing unemployed women largely and some men into the network to do this. That's the first thing. We've managed to do that. The second thing we know by how much parents value, see a change in their children, they actually see it before we even evaluate it and they see the value of smart start in their children, that their children thrive. We also have, I mean I'm now quoting a qualitative study we did two years ago, we see by how school principals and school primary school teachers see the difference in Smartstart, children who come from Smartstart, but I guess most objectively we see it by the two child outcomes evaluations that we've conducted that have consistently shown us that children who come from Smartstart are more likely to thrive if you compare with children in the population using our Thrive by Five study. So we know from experience by those three populations, but also by a scientific and independently conducted scientific evidence that exists.

47:13 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, that's good. That's insightful. Moving on to partnerships and ecosystem. Tell me about Smart Start's relationship with government, national and provincial. What has changed over the decade?

47:30 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so I mean, in the beginning it was very difficult for Smartstart to convince government that what we are thinking about is not first self-saving, it's not for us that we're doing this, what we're thinking about is actually pragmatic solutions that will help advance efforts of the country. And so that we've felt and seen massive shifts in that that was difficult in the beginning and has really strengthened in deep ways in a thinking partnership between us and the leadership of the Department of Basic Education that has resulted in really and you know not just us in the Department of Basic Education and a few other thinking partners in the ecosystem but you asking me specifically about DBE or government you said government that's why I'm starting with, it was hard to convince them that this thing, you know, this is not an ego-driven big dream that does not care about quality, we're just pushing numbers. I can see the risk of that. When you say that we have ambitions to reach a million children through this platform, everyone said, oh my God, Lord, these people are just going to be creating chaos and they're not going to achieve quality, they're just pushing We struggled to convince them of that and then seven years later we got it right in a partnership with the Department of Basic Education and we already had our first child outcomes evaluation. We had very deep insights about what drives exclusion of children. So through a joint confirmation of a joint ambition to change the future of children in South Africa, Smart Start and Department of Basic Education managed to develop a national ECD strategy. I don't know whether, this is not really what you want to sort of say, we want to just say we partnered with government, let's just put it that way, and that resulted in a national ECD strategy for the country. I'll edit some of the things that I feel are just a little bit uncomfortable to take public credit for, but that's the nature of partnerships right certain things you do but you'll never publicly say that they were done by you because we were setting a partnership with government and has really achieved significant policy and you know we started to work on the amendment of the children's act even before DBE during the DSD days and at that time during the DSD days actually we were more more on the advocacy side, you know, like sort of putting our demands down and sending whatever those things that advocacy people do. And when DBE came on board, we started to cooperate to actually put together, you know, like on building that whole legislative agenda, improvement agenda with DBE. Yeah, I mean, yeah, so you were asking me about government and did you ask me about everybody else at our ecosystem partners or you just asked me about government?

50:56 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Specifically government at a national and provincial level.

51:00 - Grace Matlhape
At a provincial level, you know it's a it's a tougher journey at a provincial level and the compliance mindset is very, very strong in the government system. The compliance mindset is the one that positions government officials at community level as the inspector. And so there's still more to be done. We have good partnerships that some of them actually have enjoyed for a long time, like we've worked with the Department of Education, Social Development, First and Education now in the Northwest for almost 10 years. So that is almost as old as Smart Start itself. But there are still mindsets that work against the actual challenge we're dealing with. If we don't succeed to transform the inspector mindset into an enabler mindset, I guess it keeps us in that risk area, where what I mean is we need government at the provincial district and inter-district level, to see themselves as supporters of ECD operators in poor circumstances, rather than policers of them. Because when you police them, you're driving negative behavior that will risk children's safety. You're driving behavior that will hide children if there are too many children. And, you know, in the end, children are unsafer, safe when we don't know the circumstances under which they are cared for. So we have a little way to go to transform mindsets at that level, but the partnerships, the thinking partnerships, the support, the working together with them, sharing the insights we've had, sharing the assets in terms of data and systems that have worked, things that have not worked, partnering on specific things like right now we're partnering very heavily on a mass registration drive, a drive to get everyone in South Africa who's doing ECD to be registered as base registration. We're cooperating a lot with them. A big proportion of those registered in the country were driven by Smart Start. They're not necessarily all Smart Start people, but when we go to those communities, we support everyone. Not just supporting Smart Start people to register.

53:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
We are going to run out of time and I have so many other questions.

53:46 - Grace Matlhape
We'll extend just a little bit, but I do need to be gone.

53:54 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm just going to touch on maybe what I consider maybe most important right now. The report talks about Smart Start as part of the early learning ecosystem, who else needs to be at the table for this to work at scale? I know we mentioned government, but who else?

54:14 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so what we have, you know, when I was telling you that one of the risks in universal access to quality early learning is that there are not a lot of other NGOs who have potential to be a smart start, a smart start. Whatever their name is, around the table of new access. So other NGOs who might be inspired or have interest to support expansion of new access at scale needs to be around the table. But to be honest with you, one of the real risks in this is not about the normal current ecosystem. The current ecosystem is made up of government, the Department of Education, NGOs, ECD funders, and parents, and local organizations as in churches and so on and so on. Has the evidence around ECD tells us that investing in children early really can build country economies, can contribute to a country that completely looks different 10 years from now. Firstly, through the children themselves who are going to be much more successful, they'll Read for meaning by grade four, and they will likely stay in school by grade and are much more likely to deliver real competence, not just ability to pass, real competence for a generation of people to drive the economy of the country. But also, all the other contributions to jobs, you're setting entrepreneurs, the entrepreneurs we recruit and set up, they employ people, they actually, the one that I'm talking about that I visited with this funder, she had five employees. Now, even our data does not show those five. We haven't told the country, the president has been driving employment, creation for the longest time. What he doesn't realize is how much ECD is contributing to employment of women in South Africa through creating employers of those people. So that is a multiplier. And so my view is who's missing around the table is the economic development thinker in the country who is thinking about what country economic development mechanisms must be accelerated. They are missing the care economy in a big way. And in the care economy, they are missing the child care economy specifically in a major way. Because when you solve that, you're solving unemployment, child success, and parents' these children going to work all at the same time. That's what's missing in the centre. So that's the challenge of the ECD sector, is to break out of the social development education mindset to actually, and you know I think as long as we call it ECD, we probably will always be stuck in this social development education mindset and, you know, meaning in some ways, and forgive me for it, a charity. What we do is not charity. What we do is economic development. And, you know, if we had a name that felt a little bit more inclusive, we would succeed better in getting those missing people around the table as well.

58:11 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And on looking forward, just briefly, Oh, I'm here.

58:18 - Unidentified Speaker
I'm just.

58:18 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Oh, I'm just on looking forward. The planning document mentions open platform orchestration. What does that mean and why is it important?

58:33 - Grace Matlhape
And what it means is also what I said earlier. The most difficult decision we've we've had to take to date. The way we've been managing the platform to date, we have very close and defined partnerships with franchisors. We have very close and defined relationships with franchisees and so on. What we want to do is find ways to open that up a little bit, give access to others who are not smart start people. For example, for an ECD organization that's going on existing in Malamulele for the last 20 years, they want to continue to do what they're doing. They don't want to be part of Smart Start, but they love the clubs. They love, they envy the Smart Starters and their clubs. You know, they want to be part of that network to benefit from what the Smart Starters are benefiting from in clubs. That's what we mean. We mean, for example, our curriculum, is driven by practice. It's a very practice-driven curriculum in daily routines. We want to be able to share the Smart Start daily routine openly, but in ways that enable people to self-drive, so that we are not micromanaging the quality assurance, but providing general guidance on activities you could do in order to improve language and literacy and language development, for example, or fine motor coordination, for example. We want a mechanism that could just share how, if you were interested in setting up something similar and you want to make it scalable, we can share models for scale that we know work, you know, what has worked in scale. So we want to make it an open platform so that know-how is distributed throughout the world by those who are interested to replicate what we've learned. I mean, they should avoid the problems we have had and the mistakes we've made, but, you know, just, you know, remove the risk, lower the risk of others making the same mistake we've made, but actually make sure The value we have acquired up to now is available to others without them feeling like they must sign up for a membership.

1:01:13 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yeah, that's what we mean. OK, so now we are focusing on reflections, but I just want to just choose one question under reflections. About your own personal growth, how has leading might start to change you over the past 10 years?

1:01:34 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, I mean, I'm just wondering whether some of this shouldn't have been scheduled in two different parts, because I'm going to think of lots more than this after the weekend. You know what I mean? I mean, I can give you five more minutes, but I suspect that we need a bit of, especially for reflections, I need a little bit of proper otherwise I might not be of real use. So for me, you know, first, you know, the more I stay in Smart Start, the more I have, so I've always been a social justice person. I have a mental health background. I really am very tuned to mental health, mental well-being, but I have a very keen interest in the actual structural drivers of mental health and marginalization and sort of exclusion are one of the biggest drivers of mental health. Like when you don't have a strong sense of belonging, identity, you are almost in a situation of a victim of circumstances kind of thing without a lot of agency to drive your own future, for example. Destiny is what I want to say. Being in Smart Start has basically deepened that insight for me very, very much. I think one of the most powerful lessons I've learned are from the women who come forward to be part of the Smart Start network. You can assume that poverty is what will destroy people. It takes away the agents. I mean, it does. It really does take away the But just a small little access to opportunity can change and transform in ways that we are almost always tending to underestimate. I have seen the power of just making opportunity available to these women, how much they take ownership of the enterprises we help them. We do minimum viable products. We do a startup, we do like a startup hack. The materials we give are the very absolute startup hack. They take that, they multiply it, they add their own Malamulele vibe. I don't know why I'm talking about Malamulele today. They add their own sort of local vibe. They drive it, they own it, and they're powerful. They are powerful. And so that probably is the the biggest lesson I have learned that it is possible when you when you ride on the agency that might not even be within their own reach because when you are marginalized and poor you feel so helpless and but when you actually and at that connect with that a little bit then you can you can achieve miraculous things and I find that, for me, that's the thing that has changed me the most. I mean, I deeply, deeply, deeply value, you know, I think, let's say, small beginnings, but also unexpected sources of power. I mean, when I came to Smart Start, I already had quite decades let's say maybe two of running organizations, so it was not my first organization to run. It humbled me totally deeply to be to go to a startup. I came from a large organization to an absolute startup startup is in our sitting in an open plan office. I was disoriented for that entire week. I didn't know how to behave. In an open plan office when I came from an that had its own boardroom and its own whatever, you know. So I was deeply, deeply disoriented by that. That humbled me massively. But in my mind, I had thought, I was not, I mean, my reality was that, oh my gosh, I'm going to be having confidential conversations with people on the phone here. And this one is sitting next to me. And as soon as I get the call, it becomes quiet and feel in the room that everyone is listening. Because you know when the CEO is having a conversation on the phone, everyone is curious to hear who you're talking to and what you are saying. Yeah, those were the humble beginnings as an organization and they were deeply insightful to me. And the other things I've been talking about about the role of structural drivers, structural excluders like the policy work and so on. And those are the things I had learned in my previous job. The things around scale, those are the things I was already bringing from my previous environment, working with others in an ecosystem of support. I had already been working in a social franchise model in my previous environment. But you know, other than that, I actually think this is one of those that it requires me to think carefully, I think some of the deepest reflections will come from when we were in a car to something and then someone said or when I was having my coffee meetings with so and so and someone said. Those are some of the moments of deeper learnings and they don't come to mind immediately. So those are the ones that come to mind at sort of the bigger sort of system wide things that I'm mentioning to you now. So the schedule another shorter session, half an hour, where I can share more reflections. It'll probably not be Monday or Tuesday, but let's see.

1:07:44 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, so another maybe half an hour, because I still had, I don't know if Thabo can respond on some of the questions, especially on impact, and I don't know if he's open to do it now, or we can let you go, or Thabo, can we schedule another meeting with you? And with space.

1:08:05 - Grace Matlhape
Some of the questions she's asked me, Thabo, you had questions, you had answers for. So that, you know, if we, because I looked at these questions, I said, there's no way that we're going to answer all of this. In fact, my suggestion, which I'm sharing with you, Thabo, is that actually we take each one of these questions and generate a blog, every single question, it's a full blog, everyone. I said to Lou, this is the whole report, this thing. It's like, one question is a whole block. If we just, you know, so Thabo already has some of these answers.

1:08:43 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Then you could start bringing me on the reflections. I can share with him the questions that were not.

1:08:51 - Conference Room (Thabo Ramphobole) - Speaker 1
I think she's got connection issues, but I will spend more time with Lou. I'll spend more time with Lou and then I'll take a look at what all the questions that she had.

1:09:00 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so if there was no way that I was ever going to do that, we were supposed to do the first half and then do the next half later, but I'm sure you can answer those table. You know it would be better if you did. Then I can rather edit the draft document, you know, and then when we schedule the next. Happen our don't ask me. The factual stuff, because you know the factual stuff. Ask me for my reflections.

1:09:34 - Conference Room (Thabo Ramphobole) - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's fine. While I have you, while I have you, I'm not sure if you saw Yousef's post on LinkedIn. I can show it to you. I just wanted to know if there's something specific you want us to speak about ahead of the book launch next week, which I think you're going to be there.

1:09:51 - Grace Matlhape
Oh my God. Is it next week? Oh my God. Yes, on Wednesday. Through the book itself. If I'm going to be, where is the book? I need to Read some of that. Okay, show me.

1:10:06 - Conference Room (Thabo Ramphobole) - Speaker 1
It's here. Let me share my screen, make sure I'm sharing with sound. Here we go.

1:10:31 - Conference Room (Thabo Ramphobole) - Speaker 2
As part of the solutions within the book, I identified seven key priorities that we as a nation should focus on. And the first priority speaks about unemployment, but also goes back a few steps and speaks about youth unemployment and education. And education is very close to my heart. Smartstart is an organization that focuses on early childhood development. And as much as my pledge to Smartstart may not have an immediate direct impact to the organization, I believe that it could have a systemic impact to them in the future as more people understand what they do and what their purpose is. So it's more about an advocacy role than a fundraising role that I'm playing for Smartstart.

1:11:15 - Grace Matlhape
You know, I can't change what is saying.

1:11:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm so sorry about the disconnection. I apologize for that. I was saying that some of the questions at the top that I had, I can maybe schedule a meeting with Thabo and then maybe the more reflection questions, then the 30 minutes meeting can be about that. And some of the things then maybe I can also just inquire um about them from uh Lante um then we can take it from there.

1:11:56 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah I think some of them will come through conversations with somebody like Rebecca for example so that would that would help you with yeah yeah some of the factual things you're asking me today for example what is an end delivered platform that's like there's only one answer and anyone can answer that in SmartStart quite honestly. Rebecca could answer that in Smartstart. My personal reflections is what we will focus on when we meet again for that half an hour. Lou will schedule that half an hour. I just know that certainly Monday will be out of the question, but I think Tuesday too. However, like Wednesday or so next week we might be able to schedule Okay, not a problem.

1:12:44 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much for your time. Thank you so much.

1:12:49 - Grace Matlhape
Thank you so much. Alright, thanks. Cheers, bye. So you you want to you asking for our response and you know actually we should we should respond both as much that and as me. Honestly, I don't. I just won't have time to go into. LinkedIn in a long, long time. I'm sure you can hear, you can feel my absence. So, I mean, honestly, it should be about welcoming, it should be about congratulating Yousuf for this powerful book that transcends the traditional definition of the role of finance but actually beginning to see the connections in society with everyday work like education, early education, and so on. I don't know what else he's talking about. And I think there we have an opportunity to deepen that connection by making the point about the quadruple impact of ECD, you know direct, we have very strong evidence of the power of ECD in just helping generations of children perform better in school and thrive as economically active citizens of the country. The power of ECD in, so it goes beyond education, I mean he's saying education there but I think the point you have to make is to say you know we you know usually we're talking about education and really fantastic wonderful it really does go beyond education and then we talk about it's such a powerful opportunity for a genderized problem like absence of child care for mothers who end up being unemployed because of concerns for the safety of their children and so on, and just talking about that child care and the labour participation of women, and then the immediate economic livelihood and economic empowerment of women business owners driving these programmes, and I think finally really elevating that building the social economy, the care economy, social economy. Really, and so I would, I guess I would make it about that. And I guess that there must be a call to action, right? That you know he's partnering with smart starting this manner is an example of how we can break boundaries of You know those exactly what we're just saying now, those divisions that assume, that relegate ECD into the social economy, not even economy, into the, you know, like, I don't know, whatever you would say, into charity, yeah, and really elevate its power in that. And then quote the Nobel laureate, because I think it always helps when you say, as the Nobel laureate economist, and call it economist, Because he's an economist, he got... Heckman. Heckman, yeah. You know, actually not in the full, I just go to say as Heckman, the Nobel laureate economist, Professor Heckman, demonstrates in his multiple studies about the economic benefits of early childhood development programs, yeah. So please, would you just think about what Smartstarts' response is and just think about what my own response will be, which would be a little bit similar but not the same. And then Lou must just post that in my name, please. For me, from my profile. I mean, Lou and I are working on it. I'm sure she talked to you about it. See, when I talk to you like this and I am telling you what to say, it's very, very easy for me. But as soon as I go going to LinkedIn, it's just, I can't, it's an action, it's an activity I need to have time for in my diary. That's why I need someone to be driving my profile like this. We will comment, I'll be very, very active if I have capacity, like what you and I, it's taken us five minutes.

1:17:39 - Conference Room (Thabo Ramphobole) - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's fine. Lou and I will interface quite a lot on that and I think that would free you up a bit more.

1:17:47 - Grace Matlhape
I will appreciate It takes us five minutes to talk about it, but it would take me 40 minutes to try and, you know, yeah.

1:17:56 - Conference Room (Thabo Ramphobole) - Speaker 1
Yeah, no, no, it has to get that one. Thank you very much for your time. Have a great weekend.

1:18:03 - Grace Matlhape
All right, you too. Thank you. No, I'm insurance. Thank you.


Part 2 CEO Grace Matlhape
Smartstart 
Fri, Feb 13, 2026

0:03 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Um, interesting. And, um, I think the experience of interviewing parents and then you interview, um, staff members and all these people, board members as well. I think it paints a clear picture. There are connections already that I can make. Um, and yeah, there are connections speaking to coaches, to franchisors, there are already connections that I think.

0:36 - Thabo Ramphobole
Okay, that's good.

0:39 - Thabo Ramphobole
That's good. As long as everything makes sense.

0:43 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yeah.

0:46 - Emmanuel luthuli
I think, yeah, you're right. I think it does make sense. I think with a little bit of some trend analysis, I think it will hit home.

0:55 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

0:57 - Thabo Ramphobole
Okay. Let's see what this last conversation with Grace yields.

1:09 - Grace Matlhape
Hi. Hello, everyone. Hi.

1:12 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Good morning. Morning, Grace. How are you doing today?

1:16 - Grace Matlhape
Well, thank you. How are you? Good.

1:20 - Unidentified Speaker
Good.

1:22 - Grace Matlhape
Okay. So, this time for one question, right? Do you have a few other questions since the last time we spoke?

1:38 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Unfortunately, yes, but we're going to see what we can get through the 30 minutes. Yeah. Do you maybe want to reflect back on maybe let's start off with your proudest moment because that's where we ended off and then maybe just go over the other questions that are still outstanding.

2:00 - Grace Matlhape
Our proudest moment, is that what we were talking about?

2:02 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yes, that's the last, but we also want to touch on the other questions that you couldn't respond to. So the question says, when you look back over the decade, what moment or achievement makes you most proud? Not organizationally, but personally?

2:25 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, I mean, I have to say that's a very difficult line to find between the person and the organization in this context. It really does have to be that area. So for me, there are a number of them. Over a period like this, you actually end up thinking back to moments and valuing small moments just as much as you value the big moments. The small moments for me has got to be when I visited one of the small moments, when I visited one of the practitioners I had met at the training as a really quiet, reserved, really person and I mean I'm telling you but I guess it doesn't have to say, unfortunately she's passed away, her name was Sbongile and Sbongile was one of the first areas where we were training people in informal settlements. So it was a very hard, it was a very hard sell to tell people who they can see for themselves that their infrastructure will not ever measure up to government. Government keeps telling them that they're breaking the law and so on. And so I visited her this once, about three or four months after the training, and she was not only in high spirits, she was so confident. She was such a different person that that moment stands out for me because I became aware of not only the economic empowerment opportunity in ECD. I started to appreciate deeply the personal agency, the personal growth, the pride. Her words were a few months ago, I was a nobody in this community and now I am someone respected. People come to me even for help. With their children's own learning. It was a very, very powerful moment for me. So I always start with that. And then, you know, there are sort of organizational moments. A big milestone was when we had our first thousand people and we invited a hundred, I think we invited, I don't we invited a hundred of the, so we had a thousand franchisees, a hundred club leaders in the city of, in the city of Joburg, in central Gauteng, and everyone could fill a room at Holland. Up to that point, you know, we were really, we started small, we started from zero, right? Like we were start-up, start-up, start-up. A thousand for a total network is a major milestone. You know, I communicated about it for weeks, just telling people, you know, we reached 1000. We can do this. This is possible. Let's not, you know, focus on the and so on and so on. It was a moment and it was a moment for me. Another one that I can't sort of, you know, it's an organizational moment and a powerful moment of pride just because in the first three years as I could see what we are doing, we were having conversations what we're getting right, but we didn't really have scientific evidence that we are achieving things that, you know, like we didn't have scientific evidence. And we're making big claims, like really want to close the gap in access, but yeah, you know, and so on. And so when we did, when we got the results of our first child outcomes evaluation, It was an amazing, it was a powerful moment for me because I could lead Smartstart Start with pride that we're making a proper change both today and in the future. So it's not just today with someone like Sbongile who I can see is transforming right in front of my eyes, but is the promise of a transformation for children, that they are on a path that is very different from where they would have been had we not arrived. If I continue now, I'll go into very similar type of milestones, but the last one that is sort of personal and organisational at the same time is when we moved out of Hollard, which which is where we were incubated, into our own offices. That's just the pride of our autonomy, how the brand could stand up. We went crazy. I mean, I'm massively obsessed with brands on a good day. But when we moved out of Holland, we got our branding right before we painted the building inside. That's how powerful that was as a moment. For us, of a moment of autonomy, a milestone of growth and visibility of a brand. We just happened to be purple and the whole act is purple and I felt like we were not visible in that context. So these are the things that stand out that are unique enough to be both personal and organisational at the same time. There are many other organisational moments that that anyone can tell you about.

8:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. Again, to move to maybe the more personal aspect, what has leading Smartstart start for 10 cost you personally and what has it given you that you didn't expect?

8:44 - Grace Matlhape
What it cost me. Your first Part was cost me. Oh, no, it has aged me 10 times. I'm sure I've aged much faster in the last years than I did in the year 10 years prior. And yet it has given me massive joy of like, you know, this is not my first rodeo. I've run organizations before that were significantly bigger than Smartstart Start. But this is the first one that I start from scratch. So, you know, so it just really aged me in that I felt like for the longest time, for a long period, and I'm sure other people in the organization were worried about what they were worried about. For the long period, I felt like I was worrying about what others were not worrying about. And so, like just leading us into the unknown was was specifically stressful, as in costs. And, you know, yeah, I mean, you know, it has not cost me anything else. It really has just been a source of deep joy and satisfaction for me, seeing the dream unfold and seeing how how that it's possible to enlist others onto the dream, for others to buy into this dream, and they buy into the dream like materially, you know, like how, when we focus on the things that we need to focus on, it's not easy, but it's possible to get others to think as big as we think. It's hard to be the first big thinker because people say, You know, they are just on some ego trip, but that's not going to happen. There's a deal with a lot of scepticism. Maybe that is one of the costs. One of the costs is dealing with the massive scepticism. Of people who are thinking you know the truth, their own truth, but they are thinking in the frame that is different from someone who's trying to solve a big problem. Your frame of thinking has to be much bigger. Even if you small, we were small. Four, five people, I used to feel like an organization of 500 people when there were five of us. And it felt like I was the only one who was seeing that organization. And so, dealing with the scepticism both internally and externally about what's possible, it's just not pleasant. It's unpleasant, um the difficulties in relationships with the ECD ecosystem where um that scepticism actually you know comes very close to like disrespect and um yeah disrespect because they you know you know you're not necessarily going to be um given the benefit of the doubt, the tendency will be, oh my gosh, no, we just ignore them. And you know, everywhere where people could criticize, they were just criticizing on open, based on assumptions, never having spoken to me, like just rude and so on. Like just the high friction in the ecosystem when you're trying to do things differently from the way everybody else thinks. So that's sort of the price you pay as a disruptor. In some ways, when you are a disruptor, you know that that's to happen. But yeah, it really was slightly over the top. Some of those relationships we are amicably rebuilding now. And yeah, so the joy of the small, small successes, the small steps of successes, the actual picture of children, I started to tell the team I was working with, then around brand that I'm beginning to see the difference between smart that children and other children. And that our brand visuals must represent that. Not clean, beautiful, perfect, uniform children. Because that's not who we are solving for. We're solving for the most excluded. So they'll be wearing a t-shirt with a tear, pants that will only be washed on Friday to save the soap, but they'll and playing. So that brand started to show up to me. I started to see this is our very proposition, you know, in where the brand is being experienced. Yeah, I mean, what else do I say?

13:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And did you miss anything because you were building Smartstart Start?

13:54 - Grace Matlhape
Did I miss anything? What did I miss? I mean, you know, when you transition from, so I'm trying to Read between the lines, I'm trying to Read your question in a nuanced way and not too literally, so that's why I'm just having to think. I mean, you know, when you're transitioning from an organisation that's established like Love Life was at that time, there's a certain of your external identity. My internal identity was in tech, but externally, Love Life was a very flamboyant, large, in-your-face organisation, and I was a face of that. I was always in media, and so I was a face of that. And so, in some ways, I lost that a little bit and struggled a little bit with identity in relation to that. You know, simply put, you know, being a CEO of Love Live for as long as I was there, made me, you know, turned me into a sort of social impact celebrity, because like HIV was always in the news and Love Live's approach was always around communication and be like in your face and so on. Smartstart start is very, very different. And, you know, even the physical environment I was in, in love life was very, very different, very fancy offices in Central, my own boardroom, those little material trappings that three months into smart start, I did not miss, you know, so that is why I'm sort of underplaying them, because I just did not miss those things. I mean, it was different it took a little getting used to, but Smartstart Start was so, I felt, yeah, it was much more connected to the context. Even in Love Life, I was solving for the same context because some of the drivers of risk of HIV are very similar to the things that drive exclusion of children from ECD. But I was a bit more distant and too important in Love Life, quite honestly. Don't use those I'll edit them out of your report. But Smartstart Start was a moment of real deep connection with the communities that I'm committed to serving. I don't know what I lost. I mean, that's a difficult decision to take. I had to see what others don't see, and I had to throw myself into the actual reason why I do what I do. For the last few decades and and smart start actually was much more fulfilling than than feeling like a loss. I'm sorry, I mean, I mean, I did actually have to deal with specific management and leadership issues. If you were honest, I really did. So when you are a startup and you are incubated by another organization, there's a certain blind spot it's like just because your organization is new you are also new you know like when you are incubated especially a corporate again some of this I'll edit out I'm telling you for your own knowledge a corporate environment can be a little too arrogant in thinking that they know what you don't know and and so it's a it's a massive adjustment to pretend that I don't already have 10 years of experience running Love Life, which actually is doing great things with very good evidence to show for it, and now have to, you know, like being taught how to balance books. So an incubation can be a difficult period for an experienced leader, you know, where everyone you to subject yourself to their infinite wisdom when actually you are there because of your infinite wisdom. You know what I'm telling you? So I had to deal with that transition and that was a rather tricky one to manage.

18:28 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And when do you feel most alive in in this work?

18:41 - Grace Matlhape
So when I actually meet the people for whom we're doing this work, when I go into the field and I see the actual visual result of the work we do, we have good data data always tells me these are the numbers and this is the rate this is you know so when you actually go um I mean that just that's just that's a renewal of of energy because you know it makes it all worthwhile and particularly when you go with other people and you have an opportunity to see smart start through the eyes of somebody else you know so when I bring government and I see what they look at. I mean it's not always positive when I bring a funder and I see the organisation through their eyes. Yeah, it's extremely rewarding but actually generally when I go into the fluid is that moment.

19:46 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I just also want to reflect back maybe on the area of your letter. This letter will be Read by franchisors who've walked this journey with you, smart starters who've built their lives through this platform, funders deciding whether to invest, government partnerships considering policy changes. If you could look at them in the eye and say one deeply personal thing, one message that unites everyone, what would it be?

20:22 - Grace Matlhape
Oh gosh, I wonder whether, oh my gosh, oh Lord, that's a trick question. You know, as you were talking, it felt to me like the letter is you believed in a dream. I mean, the message is you believed in the dream without evidence of that dream. Like, you know, when people give you trust, when all you are saying It's a very, very powerful thing. I mean, I can't say it was easy. It's just you took a chance when I did not even give you too much evidence that that was the chance worth taking. I was telling you that this is the chance worth taking because of how I feel about the problem sometimes, what I believe, what I learned, the insights I generated over time, but like you came along, you joined the movement before it became a movement. I don't know whether we have a movement now, you know, so like that every contribution from every aspect of the ecosystem you just described, one couldn't exist without the other. And especially when we're building from scratch. It's a small miracle that so many, call 16,000, it 16,000 because it's just been, I've been trying to get this number to 16,000 and it's not getting there as I want. 16,000 women entrepreneurs across South Africa who are making a living out of this when they had other options, maybe they didn't even have other options. And it was not easy, but they chose to stay on the hope that we know what we are doing, we are trying to solve the problem with them. And we will, if we continue to try and not give up, we will eventually get there. Investors who really are just committed to ECD, but actually are putting their trust in me and my leadership and the team of people surrounded myself with, to solve a rather tough problem, a rather tough problem. And they continued to invest even when we were not succeeding as we thought we would. You know, so it really is you stuck, you bought into a dream that did not have much more than dream. You stuck with that dream, even when our successes were not as we had hoped And you really enabled success that is now globally visible in ways that it's not always seen, that it's not just Grace. It's Grace and an army behind me. I have no idea how you're going to write that letter, but that's sort of my feeling about it.

23:32 - vuledzani Tshivhase
It's Grace and an army behind me. Me. So that's, I think, the biggest takeaway. When someone finishes reading this letter, what feeling do you want to leave them with? What emotional note do you want to end on? Is it inspired, challenged, grateful, or hopeful?

23:59 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah. I can Read your lips as you muted yourself but I could Read your lips. Yeah, so I am, yeah, I think inspired and hopeful. You know, we still need everyone's image because we haven't arrived. So I don't want to say challenged because even If they are existing, if they are people who are Part of the network now, we don't need to challenge them. They already bought in. But we know we haven't arrived. We're still on this journey. This is a milestone on a journey that will be long. And so we have not arrived. Left. So I'm inspired and hopeful. But we haven't arrived, but we are on the right track, in a way.

25:11 - vuledzani Tshivhase
That forms most of the questions that we wanted to hear around your letter. Is there anything else?

25:20 - Grace Matlhape
Gosh, I mean, how can there be anything? Like, what haven't you asked me? There can't be anything else. Can you think of anything else?

25:30 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Maybe we can touch on the next decade and platform vision just to finalize maybe the more technical questions.

25:45 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

25:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Talking about transitioning toward open platform orchestration and pathways forward. In plain language, when you imagine Smartstart Start in 2035, what does it look like, What's different from today?

26:06 - Grace Matlhape
Did you want to say something else?

26:07 - Thabo Ramphobole
I was thinking something along what the future holds, but also maybe something you want people to know about the women and the children that have been Part of the for the past 10 years.

26:20 - Grace Matlhape
Oh God, now you're asking me for world peace. Yeah, so okay, so let me answer the first.

26:37 - Thabo Ramphobole
Is she frozen?

26:38 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, she is.

26:52 - Thabo Ramphobole
Let's just see that. We lost you there for a bit.

26:55 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did. We lost electricity for about two seconds, so that is why you lost me. So yeah, so when we talk about the open platform, I'm not sure what, I can't remember what Filiotsani's question was, can you just Read the question, or should I just answer it the way I understand it?

27:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
You can also answer it the way you understand it, that's fine.

27:25 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so 10 years later, we've arrived in 2025, which is the year of your report. With a good sense of what we've achieved, what works, what doesn't work, but more importantly, what we've achieved. We've also arrived at this point with the sense that the work, there's still a lot of work to be done. There's still a lot of children to reach, but that, you know, it's not the work of one organization. And so we are thoughtful about what we have that we can share with others so that more and more organisations can be attracted to helping close the gap in access to quality early learning. So it makes us think about how we make the assets we've accumulated, including the brand, much more sort of collectively owned, like transitioning from Smartstart that as the organisation in Dankelt that looks, let's forget what it looks like, like the organization in Dankelt to be a local and trusted brand that represents quality in all contexts, early learning quality in all contexts, whether, whatever the context is, the sort of small local beacon of hope of that quality being accessible to all children. That's sort of the brand I'm feeling we have to transition to. So when we say open platform we mean that. We mean that Smartstart does not belong to Dankelt or Rosebank. It belongs to most excluded community in South Africa. It's trusted locally, it's influenced locally, it's effective locally, in solving access gap challenges of children in those communities.

29:37 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And I think that was the question that Thabo also asked.

29:42 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so ask again Thabo.

29:48 - Thabo Ramphobole
Basically, kind of like a takeaway of what you'd want people to know, everybody who's going to be reading this, about the women and the children that have been Part of the past 10 years.

30:01 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so let me start with the, with the women. I mean, you know, the sad thing about poverty is that it diminishes people. It makes them feel invisible, like Bungile was saying to me. It diminishes, it takes away. And the people I have met in the last 10 years are the most powerful, most inspiring, self-driven. I'm not saying every single one, but everyone's on their own journey of their own velocity. But I have met some of the most inspiring, passionate, socially committed change agents of my life in this in this work. I have met women who maybe at some point they give into the temptation to ask for more. Like when I say, you know, they say you can give us more toys or whatever. Sometimes they give into the temptation to ask for more, but actually when I'm not in the room, when none of us are in the room, when they are facing the reality of their context, they are some of the biggest problem solvers. Some of them have been on a journey from unemployment to, and every time I say this I feel like I'm lying, but unemployed to employer of people. I feel like I'm lying because employer in a low economic context is sort of, it's a little bit of an employer with a small e, but they do actually get other women to work with them and they pay them for the work that they do. So they do grow enterprises with the most fantastic agency of their own, like self-driven agents of their own. So I'd like people to see them, not as beneficiaries of our ledgers, but as our partners who are actually fulfilling a really important public priority. I mean, that even last night, the president was talking about the importance of the LES commitment by government. Without that last mile, all of our dreams will come to naught. That particular last step of the interaction between this woman who herself is deprived and a child in her community, and who is themselves deprived and might have whatever challenges that come with that. You know, they face they're inspiring. And so I'd like for us all to see them, not as beneficiaries, but as valued partners to enable a really important public service. I mean, the children, I mean, what I can say about the children, I guess, is what I said about what the brand looks like, You know, when I look at the pictures, I can actually immediately you know, this is the Smartstart Start brand, that isn't, looking at children and their facial expressions. A big Part of the Smartstart Start program is about the child themselves, child-directed learning. So we are hoping to be contributing to building a generation of children who are in control of their environment, are self-driving, who see themselves and value others in their environment, and, you know, who are kind and curious and, you know, ready to take on the challenges of life as contributors. And the families that they are in, also, you know, I mean, in the Smartstart Start, model, we are intentional in positioning parents also as partners. So a pillar of our early learning approach is about parent partnership. Yeah, so I mean, I've taken this in exactly the order of my inspiration. I mean, for me, the most important thing is that these are not beneficiaries. These are agents of change that we are partnering to enable their own delivery to be of the that will just make the future of this country possible.

34:44 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I think I might just have one last question that I just received now.

34:48 - Grace Matlhape
Let me just see if I'm not keeping someone waiting somewhere.

35:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
What do you hope happens for early childhood in South Africa by 2035? Especially around policy.

35:08 - Grace Matlhape
Yeah, so we've achieved really important policy transformations in the last two to three years in South Africa, and so I'm hoping that South Africa will have the courage to continue to drive policy in the direction of the problem, not in the direction of our control. That's the one of the biggest, like if we continue to drive policy in the direction of the problem we are trying to solve, and that by 2035 we will be at universal coverage to universal access to quality early learning with enough variety for caregivers, parents to have a choice in where they want their children to be and that choice should not be driven by affordability, it must be driven by what they want for their children. Early learning. I'm hoping that South Africa will have succeeded to position itself as a leader on the continent and globally as a country in ECD that at the ecosystem level we will build more and more innovation around access, new access and quality improvement or quality assurance in ECD in South Africa. I'm hoping that the connections between early learning and other elements of ECD like caregiver support will have matured so that parents, you know, the home learning environment is as powerful a place for children to learn as the centre or an out of home learning environment is. So I am hoping for world peace, honestly, in the area of ECD, like 2035 is five years after the time that we have both in our national development plan and the national ECD strategy that Minister Mutserha launched two years ago.

37:15 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much. I think you have answered all our questions. I don't know if there's anything else.

37:27 - Grace Matlhape
That's it from me.

It’s set for Thursday 3pm on 29 Jan 2026. 2 questions added to cater for the scope alteration


Thu, Jan 29, 2026

0:08 - Thabo Ramphobole
Hi Carley.

0:10 - Unidentified Speaker
Hi Pavel, how are you?

0:11 - Thabo Ramphobole
I'm well thanks, how are you?

0:12 - Carley Furness-Symms
Good, thank you very much.

0:21 - Thabo Ramphobole
So I just wanted to introduce Bilazani, who is going to be talking to you through this interview. I'm going to leave it in there. To continue with you.

0:34 - Carley Furness-Symms
So it's not Immanuel? So I thought I was expecting Immanuel.

0:38 - Carley Furness-Symms
No, Immanuel is a project lead.

0:41 - Thabo Ramphobole
So he's asked other people to take over because there's a lot of interviews going on at the moment.

0:47 - Carley Furness-Symms
That's absolutely fine.

0:51 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Good afternoon, everybody.

0:52 - Carley Furness-Symms
How are you? I'm great. How are you? Thank you. Lungi was also here. Hi, Lungi. Or not. At least we need Lungi to chime in now. Vuledzani, if you want to go ahead. Okay, yes.

1:29 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Vuledzani. Joining me today is my colleague, Lungiswa. We are from Auxeira. We are assisting in writing the 10-Year Report for Smart Start. I don't know if you want to introduce yourself to us, Carley.

1:52 - Carley Furness-Symms
My name is Carley Sims, and I am one of the board members, one of the founding board members of Smartstart. And up until December of last Year was the chairperson of the Smartstart board and have also worked for one of the largest funders of Smartstart. So I'm linked to Smartstart through that relationship, but also based in Jo'burg and South Africa. So not arm's length from what's going on, but very much part of what's happening.

2:29 - Lungiswa
Hi everyone, my name is Lungiswa Zibi and yeah thanks to me for college.

2:35 - Thabo Ramphobole
Nice to meet you too.

2:44 - Thabo Ramphobole
I'm Thabo, I work for Smart Start so I've been liaising with Lante Emmanuel on facilitating all these interviews.

2:52 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.

2:54 - Thabo Ramphobole
Good to meet you.

2:56 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, Carley, are you ready to start? Yeah, go ahead. Okay, just to go over the introduction again, thank you again for making the time with us. As board chair, you had a unique vantage point on Smart Start's 10-Year journey. This interview will form the basis of your letter in the annual Report. We want to capture reflections on governance, key challenges and lessons set, and what you see ahead of Smart Start.

3:34 - Lungiswa
All right, thank you so much, Vule. So the first set of questions are looking at the governance and leadership, so your experience around that. The first question is, how did you come to be involved with Smart Start, what drew you to this work?

3:51 - Carley Furness-Symms
So the organisation I work for, the Elmer Philanthropies, the philanthropic services arm of the Elmer Cooper Foundations, was one of the founding organisations of Smart Start. So my involvement with Smart Start started right from the beginning when, in partnership with and in conversation with the DG Murray Trust, Lifa Labantwana, Yellowwood, the Hollow Trust, and Kaka Yobano, we were trying to figure out what we could do to try and increase access to early childhood services and early learning services. So I was part of a team that was, yeah, part of the team thinking through what we needed to do, what our ambition would be, and then setting up the actual organization. So I've been involved from the start there. And part of it is just because one, early childhood development is one of the core focuses of the Elmer Philanthropies where I work. So this is why we were interested in the work and how I ended up around the table.

4:49 - Lungiswa
All right, great. Thanks, Kylie. In terms of your role as the chair, what do you see as the board's most important contribution to Smart Start over the past decade?

5:07 - Carley Furness-Symms
The board's most important contribution? I think because of how smart that was started and sort of the active role that all of the initial board members play in the ECB ecosystem outside of their involvement in Smartstart. I think the most helpful role that the board has played in setting this up and getting it going has really been around enabling Smartstart to build off things that already exist, not have to reinvent the wheel, giving it the ability to mobilize our networks, mobilize our partnerships, build off some of the programs that we've already developed, constantly making sure that it's connected to other opportunities and capitalizing on those. And then as the board slightly expanded, then we had sort of observers joining the board as well from other partners like DLK, is that right? Sort of the additional value that was added was new networks that were mobilized globally to resource the work of Smartstart. And I think that's been a really helpful role that the board played in that space too.

6:16 - Lungiswa
Great, thank you. Smart Start has grown significantly under Grace's leadership. As the board chair, how have you supported that growth? And also, what have been your key governance challenges?

6:37 - Carley Furness-Symms
Sorry, so what, let me just check I'm understanding the question. So just reflecting on Grace's, Grace's role as the lead driver of Smartstart and what the board has done to support her.

6:49 - Lungiswa
Yes, basically reflecting on the leadership transition. So Grace's leadership, reflecting on that, and also reflecting on key governance challenges that you've experienced during your, Chair, person, period, yeah.

7:09 - Carley Furness-Symms
I mean, Grace has been the leader the whole way through, and I think that's a position she's always held very well. So I think it's been from all the years that I've been the board chair, it has been more about providing a good sounding board, providing an opportunity for her to discuss complex issues, to highlight sort of, challenges we foresee in the ecosystem or strategy, but I feel like Grace is, yeah, it has been driven under Grace owning this process and owning this organisation and really driving it. And the board has been deeply supportive of that rather than, yeah, I think that's been the best role to describe it. It's trying to be supportive and create space for her to be able to think, to engage outside of her institution. I mean, the governance challenges are the same ones that I think many organisations as you grow? Have we got the right policies in place? Have we got the right practices in place? Do we have the right organizational structure in place for what we're doing? And I think the governance, it's hard to think governance in the sort of formal governance sense, but I think some of the biggest challenges we faced is trying to really think through our organization and the strategy in response to what we've been learning as Smartstart has been rolling out and scaling. So I think our challenges have been how to not be too wedded to what we thought we were doing, how to be responsive to what's coming up from the ground and allowing the strategy to shift and change and ensuring that we are supporting the organization to be built in the same way that's responsive to that shifting strategy. Making sure that we actually have the right people in place and the right systems in place. I mean, I think financial governance always a big one. So I think that making sure we have strong financial systems and not just policies, but actually well implemented policies in places as an organisation grows as rapidly as Smart Start has, I think is a big one. But outside of that, I think, yeah, those have been the main things we've had to grapple with.

9:19 - Lungiswa
Thank you so much, Carley, for that reflection and reflecting particularly on Greece. But also maybe if you don't mind also touching on how you as the board chair have supported the growth of Smart Starts.

9:39 - Carley Furness-Symms
That's a tricky one because you know the board's role is not necessarily to be as hands-on and day-to-day in what's going on in Smart Start. So I think I've seen the role that I've played is far more of being available to support Grace and the team and sort of add additional, what is that? It's a legitimacy, but as Grace and the team have had to engage with government, as Grace and the team have had to engage with other funders, have had to sort of engage with the sector, the role that we've been able to play, certainly myself and other board members, and as a chairperson as well, is one of being able to add to those conversations. So be available and be in those conversations to speak from a governance and from a funder perspective to back what's happening with Smart Start, to add a different lens to it, to make sure the role that we play in the sector of bringing people together has been enabled and Smart Start is supported and Grace and her team are supported through it. So it's been very much that sort of role of making sure that as Smart Start goes after things, as the board, we are there to make sure that we are adding our voice to it, demonstrating our commitment to whatever it is we're working on, That's been the main role I think we've played as we think about the growing and the scaling of Smart Start. It's been at that level rather than in the day-to-day, how does the mechanism work?

11:01 - Lungiswa
Thanks for that. In terms of the organisational maturity, how has Smart Start evolved as an organisation over the past 10 years? What's different about how it operates now versus 2015 when everything started?

11:19 - Carley Furness-Symms
I mean, obviously, it's grown in its depth of leadership. I think that's the part that's been most interesting to watch, even over the shortest last period of three, four years, is to watch how the depth of leadership and the breadth of responsibility has been distributed into the institution, which I think is powerful. I mean, when it started, I can still recall it was Grace and Nomsa sitting in an office with one or two other people around them. You know, the board was actively involved. Everybody was actively involved in every part of it. I think it's really evolved quite, in many sense, very impressively to have sort of a really depth of spread leadership and ownership of the different pieces. I'm always impressed when I sort of visit and we have board meetings or we have any kind of engagement with Smart Start at how well owned it is by everybody across every different department. You can see see people own the work that they do. They aren't waiting for someone to instruct them or tell them what to do, but you can see that they're driving with, they're pushing it forward. They always have a sort of a very excellent approach to everything they do. And that's been impressive to watch as the institution has grown. That entrepreneurial driven culture is still deeply vested within the organization. And they are dynamic. And I think that's a piece that I hope that they manage to retain as they scale. Opportunistic, they're looking for solutions, they're dynamic, yeah.

12:48 - Lungiswa
Great, thank you so much Kali. I'll hand over to Vule to take us through the next set of questions.

12:55 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much Lumi, thank you. Thank you again Kali for sharing. The next set of questions focus on strategic decisions and challenges. What will the three hardest strategic decisions the board had to make over the past decade?

13:20 - Carley Furness-Symms
It's not to limit you to three. No, it's to try to think of three. I mean, the one that's the top of mind has definitely the piece around shifting the thinking of how we were going to reach scale. I think when SMART saw started, it was very much like, can we do a franchise type model? And very much the thinking of like a Lando's type franchise, an actual business franchise. This is the package exactly. Everything's manualized. This is how you deliver it. This is the quality. And getting to the first 1,000 practitioners really quickly using that fidelity, but having to really stop, rethink, reframe, take a step back from the way we thought we were doing it as we started to get further and further up that sort of scaling journey and having to shift the way we were thinking about how Smart Start scales and what Smart Start's role is in the ecosystem. I think there was another one of the big shifts is what was Smart Start's role? I think initially it was a delivery and focus on delivery, but I think it was another big shift and we recognized that actually Smart Start itself had to be an active role player in the ecosystem systemic change. So I think that was a big shift when we seconded Rebecca into the Department of Basic Education, which turned out to be a really key opportunity for Smart Start. But again, that was a big strategic shift where we were having to think very differently about what we thought Smart Start was and what it was going to do and achieve and how it was going to get there. I think those continue to be the big strategic complexities that we've grappled with. I mean, some of the other things we've had to grapple with over the years is, you know, which are the right partners to partner with, especially around resourcing? You know, is it the right time to bring in a really complicated partner, like, let's say, the Jobs Fund? And are we ready for it? And can we do it? And do we stick with it or not? Does it make sense? Those have also been sort of very strategic conversations, because, of course, resourcing is a big part of running any institution in this sector. So I think there's been a lot of grappling around you know, that, like, how do we bring in the right kinds of funding streams, the right time, and make sure they remain suited to what we're doing? And I think the other one is also a lot of grappling with what's the right structure for this organization? You know, it's part of the governor's oversight role is helping think through the organogram, certainly at a senior executive level, and supporting the CEO to recruit the right people and retain right people. And I think that has also been something we've grappled with over the years a number of times, really difficult strategic decisions. What should it look like, What kinds of skills do we need there? How do we make sure we get the right kind of skills and retain them? How do we ensure that this model, this operating model is actually working effectively for Smart Start and having to also let go of what we thought was right and experiment and have the room to make mistakes? I think that's been another big piece of that we've had to do at a strategic level.

16:33 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And on risk and management, what risks kept you up at night as chair? How did you and the board navigate them?

16:44 - Carley Furness-Symms
What risks kept me up at night? So many. One, will we get government to think differently about ECD? And actually really come alongside and help us solve the access, the quality access question. You know, that for many years was touch and go. Yeah, I mean, I think probably of everything, how do we bring a key role pair that is in charge of policy and supposed to help resourcing and thinking and leading the sector certainly under the Department of Social Development was really we're battling to get them to acknowledge and see home and community-based care and early learning programs. So I think that one kept me awake for a very long time and certainly with the Department of Education where they are now keeps me awake less because I think they've joined in and seen that we've got a massive gap that needs to be an access gap that needs to be a quality access gap needs to be addressed. The other ones were certainly, certainly still, still here, still there are ones around sort of sustainability is constantly one. I mean, it's the one thing is the sustainability of smart start, we're constantly keeping awake on how do we keep the network and the practitioners on the smart side of themselves? How do we ensure that they are finding some sustainability in themselves? And then of course, there's always the thing of making sure our systems work in a way that children protected and safe, that's also been a big piece that I think has certainly kept me awake at night is, you know, in such a dispersed network, so many practitioners and running their own practices and their own micro enterprises, are we putting all the right things in place to make sure that the children, the practitioners and the children are safe? And yeah, so those would be the three things that have kept me up at night.

18:48 - vuledzani Tshivhase
How did you and the board navigate them?

18:54 - Carley Furness-Symms
Oh, gosh. I mean, the government question was because everybody has been lobbying. I suppose lobbying is the wrong word, because I think that's a US word, and we certainly weren't doing what they do. Advocacy and engagement. I mean, I think what every single person on the board, and certainly the Smartstart team themselves, But all of us in our various capacities have been advocating at various levels within the state, first with DSD and then with DBE and at the presidency and across the board with Treasury and in partnership with the LIFA, really advocating, building evidence, building demonstratable. I mean, the evidence piece has been so huge around what are we actually talking about and that there is a real thing here and this has to be addressed and demonstrated. And so I think that's been the biggest role that everyone on the board has played in their various capacities. It's making sure that their voice is also adding into and all the work that they're doing outside of just Smart Start is adding into building that evidence base and the advocacy and the relational, building the relationship with the right people at the right levels to actually be heard about what we think is really crucial for the city sector. So that's certainly a big piece about how to deal with government. I mean, around the care and support reports and safety issues. That's been really about making sure what policy SMART has in place. How are we making sure that the practitioners are well supported? What reporting mechanisms do we have? Do we have good child protection policies? Those sorts of things. I'm trying to think what the other one that's keeping us awake at night. Was it funding? Yeah, I think that's been a piece that sort of certainly our partners at the board who on the board who have a youth enterprise lens and are working in that side have also been working quite hard to figure out how do we unlock that piece of the puzzle for a lot of the practitioners and how do we enable these a lot of the young people that are setting up Smart Start practices or their own sort of their own Smart Start service site, how do we support them to access the supports that are available for youth entrepreneurship and job creation. So it's been a lot of those sort of trying to figure out how we unlock those pieces and trying to block the ECD subsidy for the smart starters. And that again has been working with a variety of partners around lobbying, around demonstrating and building evidence and supporting piloting of programs. But it's been, I suppose when you asked me all of this, I realized and I reflect on the fact that the members of the board, because they all do this work outside of just sitting on the board of Smart Start, I think it's been part of what they've been doing for the ecosystem and Smart Start as one of their major partners in the ecosystem. Rather than because they are on the board of an organisation.

21:43 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Moving on. In reference to model validation, when did the board become confident a franchisor model was viable at scale and what evidence mattered most in that Gosh, when did the board become convinced?

22:05 - Carley Furness-Symms
Well, I'm not sure we ever, I'm not sure we, I'm not sure the franchisor model is the thing that we are landing on. I mean, I say that because if I think about where Smart Start is now, they're not doing a pure franchise model, really. They're not doing what I think would fall into a very typical franchise model. So they are allowing for local adaptation and local innovation. And I would rather say, if you ask me, when did the board become convinced that what Smart Start was doing was actually making a difference? I think the early part was engaging with the actual smart starters and seeing the smart starters who'd taken up the opportunity and were feeling supported and could anecdotally talk about sort of what being involved in a network, what the Smart Start network and the Smart Start training and support had done for them, and how it had shifted their life trajectory. So that was the first and the earlier sort of evidence that was coming through was for the actual Smart Starters. But certainly, I think when the first external evaluation using the Elon tool was undertaken, and we started seeing evidence of the quality of the outcome for the children involved in the program, I think that was when the real Power came in to say we had built this, Smart Start had built this, we supported Smart Start to build this, and they understand that we were putting in place best practices, we were using the best of whatever was produced, but now we can talk about the fact that actually we were seeing child outcomes improve in these home and community-based service sites and Smart Start sites. So I think certainly that was a big shifting point of the ability to really tell a story. We'd started building up a story, They were anecdotally from the parents, the caregivers, and the practitioners themselves, which was very useful. And also useful in the way that the gaps that they were raising also needed to be addressed, but certainly it was giving us a sense that they were seeing value in this. And then I think the child outcomes evidence came that really made us certain that this is the right direction to go. I mean, I think, I don't want to oversell the fact that, I mean, the whole way through we've been very cognizant of the risks. The whole way through it was, So I think it's always been recognizing there are so many inherent risks, but willing to forge ahead with the fact that we knew enough was there and that we would try and make sure we solve for those inherent risks as best as we could within the ecosystem to make the model, to make the approach work.

24:39 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, thank you for that. I know you touched on sustainability and maybe, reflect on it again now in this next question. What have been the biggest challenges around funding and financial sustainability? How has the board addressed them?

25:02 - Carley Furness-Symms
Interestingly, I think the big challenge, there were a couple of times for Smartstart itself as we were building this and the core funders had underwritten it for a number of years, where the funding, the funding to scale it up wasn't certain. And I think that was a big challenge on sustainability is that we were trying to figure out how to scale and continue to provide support to the smart starters that were in the system already. So I think those were some of the challenges for smart start specific, because of course it has to resource itself. And I think Grace and the team have done exceptionally well whatever traction we got and just really maximize it to build out Smart Start's reputation, such that I think Smart Start is really well resourced at the moment and has a few pipelines to really support it to get to its scale ambition. I think the part that the sustainability piece that we're still working so very hard on is actually the Smart Start as sustainability, because I think that's where the magic's really got to lie. And I think that's a, it's not a straightforward answer. I think we were just acknowledging that different market segment means different kinds of supports and they're going to have to be multiple streams of income for each of the smart starters. So I think a big focus has been where there is a market that's viable to bring in some income, how do we support the smart starters to actually access and tap that market? So we're paying fees or community support or whatever that may be. There's been substantial amounts of work to unlock resourcing via the ECD subsidy Like I said, the youth employment programs, the jobs fund. So I think those have been the ways in which we've been looking at how do we supplement parent income or where there isn't any parent income? How do we make sure that there's some resource in going to the smart starters? I don't think we've perfected it yet, but I certainly think we've made substantial progress and more and more the fact that the state is no longer not seeing them as legitimate programs that are actually offering a quality service the closer we get to getting them into a loop where they at least get some sustainable resourcing from the Department of Education's ECD subsidy, while we also look at other mechanisms to help them set up their micro enterprises and sustain them over the long term.

27:27 - Thabo Ramphobole
Sorry, before you go on, I have to hop off. Thank you, Kali, for your time, and thank you, vuledzani and Lungi, Thank you.

27:40 - Carley Furness-Symms
Thank you so much.

27:42 - Carley Furness-Symms
Thanks, Thabo.

27:54 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Looking back on lessons learned, what would you have done differently in Smart Start's first decade?

28:04 - Carley Furness-Symms
That's a good question. What would I have done differently? I don't know that I could actually answer that in any coherent way. I don't know. I feel like all the lessons that we learned in testing and experimenting were valuable, so it's hard to look back. And say we would have done it very differently. I mean, probably the only thing I can think of off the top of my head is looking back and knowing what COVID turned out to be. We might have figured out a bit better how to really support the organization, the Grace, and the team even better through that period. Because I think none of us really realized as we went into COVID what chaos it was going to be. And so I certainly think that COVID period which is really exceptionally difficult. So I suppose in reflection back, had I known we were going into such a really, really trying time, it would have been to maybe more proactively think about how to support the organisation and the teams within it. But outside of that, I mean, I think every lesson that has been learnt along the way was really valuable. And I think actually the journey of getting to where we are was necessary. So I don't know if I would have changed anything.

29:39 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, over to you Lungi.

29:45 - Lungiswa
All right, thank you Vulé. Thanks again Carley for just taking us through Smart Start's incredible and very inspiring journey. Now I will be moving on to reflect on impact and recognition of Smart Start. So the Report that we presented celebrates the franchises, practitioners, partners who've built Smart Start. From a governance perspective, what do you want to recognize about the network?

30:17 - Carley Furness-Symms
I don't even know what it means from a governance perspective. What would that mean if you say from a governance perspective?

30:23 - Lungiswa
So from maybe the perspective of you being part of the board, what does that mean? Do these stakeholders mean to you in terms of, yeah, the work you do as a board?

30:39 - Carley Furness-Symms
Yeah, I mean, that's a good question. So, I mean, from where we're sitting as, I suppose, as the board, as with the reflection on, so the certainly, so reflections on the practitioners is just sort of an immense sense of being just so impressed and so proud of who they are and what they do on a day-to-day basis, and how much innovation and ingenuity and resilience that they bring to the network. I think the board often reflects on the fact that the power of this entire thing is the practitioners themselves. They are the power of Smart Start. They are the power of the network. And every time we have the privilege of going out and going into different communities and meeting with smart starters directly and hearing their stories. I'm just always blown away at just how much this is theirs, how much they own it and they feel ownership for it. So that's deeply impressive for us as a board because obviously we sit quite arm's length from that and we try and make strategic decisions about direction and resourcing. But going and hearing how this has become their own thing and how much they feel ownership for it and they're driving it for themselves is really, really impressive. It's a really impressive group of predominantly women and some men too. So I think that's from our reflection often at the board is that the real power of this network sits there. We support and facilitate, but the smart starters are what makes smart start. And then the partners, I think also there's a deep respect for the role that they're actually playing. I think when we started, we didn't know how we were going to scale this. And I think we had some partnerships, some direct service. We were testing out a series of models. But I think the further we've gone along this road, I think the deeper respect we've gotten for the role of each local partner who actually is driving change in their own context. So I think, again, it's a real partnership. And I think there's a lot of respect the role that each and every one of them play in this and how they themselves, particularly in the last Year or two, how they've all taken up their own ownership of the space and actually Smartstart has become theirs too. So we've been deeply impressed with that. And then of course it's the Smartstart team. Yeah, just a hardworking group of people. We're just deeply, deeply impressed with the level of commitment, time, effort that they just continuously into this. From the outside, because if you don't sit in that office, every time you're there, you're just really impressed by the level of passion and excitement the team brings to the work that they're doing. I'm really impressed by how Smart Start, the hub, has really managed to pull in interesting people from different spaces and get them excited about early childhood development. So that's just really exciting to watch that we actually have become an advocate for early childhood outside of traditional early childhood services. But really making it sort of a topic that's so much more people's lips and people think it's a valuable sector to be part of, which it wasn't when we started. So, so much respect for the team in that space. So, all in all, I think Smart Start's impact has just been far broader than we even realized. I think it's really created a lot of momentum around early childhood, not on its own, but certainly it has been a catalyst in the sector of creating a whole new momentum around early childhood that's been deeply impressive to watch happen.

34:22 - Lungiswa
Very interesting. Now looking at the impact to the child, when you think about the children who've benefited from Smart Start, what impact matters most to you personally?

34:41 - Carley Furness-Symms
What impact matters the most Safe, happy, learning children. It's lovely to go and see kids who you can see are safe. Kids who are not stressed about, who are actually engaging in their learning because they've managed to create a space and a place in their lives, regardless of their context. That the children in the program, yeah, they feel loved, looked after, safe, cared for, and then learning in that space. And I think that's been the power of it, is that the focus has been not on academic knowledge for the practitioner, but it's been really on her practice and what she does in her classroom or her space, wherever she's running a program, and watching that in action and just seeing how the children are responding to it and knowing so much about adverse childhood ACEs, Adverse Childhood Experiences, and the power of at least one safe adult. I think that's, for me, been so impactful. When smart thought works well and works the way it should, it really is something that can shift somebody's trajectory.

35:54 - Lungiswa
That's wonderful to hear. Again, from a governance perspective, what systems level change would you say Smart Start contributed to beyond its direct programs? So I think you've already provided some insights but like what maybe one thing that you can mention around systems level change that Smart Start has contributed beyond its core programs?

36:26 - Carley Furness-Symms
I mean this is the I suppose for me there'll be two pieces to it that I think Smart Start has been a key player in shifting because I think I can't say it's only been Smart Start, but I think they've been a really key player, is the recognition and acknowledgement by the Department of Basic Education of home and community-based programs. I think that's been massive, and that's not just for Smart Start. That's for all the practitioners that have been providing childcare and child early learning services in different modalities. The fact that Smart Start, together with its partners and others have gotten an acknowledgment of the different modalities and the fact that quality lives in so many different places and spaces, that acknowledgment is huge. Because now you're able to bring everyone into the net and people are not ignored because they don't look the way that we would think, you know, one certain way of what quality looks like, Meanwhile, it's not actually quality. Another huge shift is exactly that, this question of what is quality? And it's been so wonderful to watch this thrive by five feet building and the more evidence keeps building, that we are shifting the conversation to what is actual driver of quality, not what are the inputs that we all like, qualifications and physical infrastructure, but what are the actual drivers of quality that actually result in a child being able to enter grade R and grade one ready to learn, healthy, safe, just ready to go. That's been a big shift that Smart have been part of driving as well. So I was the one was that. Yeah, I think I think those are the main ones in my mind that like we at the shifting of the system is thinking differently about how we're going to get and then I know the other big shift that smart sort of been a key part of again with its partners is the acknowledgement that we have an access gap. I kid you not, I can remember in 2019 on a call or 2020 during COVID being on a call where someone was literally telling that there is no access gap. There are no children not getting service. There are none of these informal centers. There was actually an argument happening in government sectors. I mean, this was like an intersectoral forum meeting. It wasn't sort of on the ground. And I think that's been a major victory, is this acknowledgement of the children that are falling outside of the system because the system's blind to them. And again, these are not things that are just for Smart South. These are things actually that are for the country. So I think those are big systems pieces, I think. And actually, I keep reiterating this, because I think Smartstart's been a driving force, but it's also had really key partners that it's worked with that have been bringing the same message. So as a collective, that's been a massive win.

39:07 - Lungiswa
Yeah, wonderful, wonderful insights. I'm handing over to Roulette.

39:16 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you, Kylie, for being so insightful. You are sharing so much. We've looked back on the past decade, now in this section we are looking forward. What are your strategic priorities for Smart Start over the next 10 years?

39:44 - Carley Furness-Symms
Over the next 10 years? I'm cautious because, I mean, I can't speak as a board. I mean, because we haven't had a 10-Year vision. We still kind of very much know. We want to get to a million, making sure at least a million children, a million children who were excluded from quality access are receiving it. So that's still always going to be our North Star. And I think that would still be where our ambition is for Smart Start, is to make sure that there are enough places of early learning whatever modality that is, that are supported and seen within the regulatory framework, that every child has access to a quality start to life. That would still be the ambition in the tenure. I mean, we're getting closer, but we certainly aren't there yet. So I think it kind of aligns to the DBE 2030 strategy, universal access to quality early learning. Still remains, I think, the north star of where we're heading towards.

40:53 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you. Thank you for that. And how does the board need to evolve to support Smart Start's next chapter? How does the what? The board need to evolve to support Smart Start's next chapter.

41:07 - Carley Furness-Symms
How does the board need to evolve? I mean, the board's already having conversations about this. I think we are looking into thinking about what other skills and perspectives can we add to the board as we start really going into this ramping up scale network effects partnerships. So I think it's been primarily around thinking about what additional skills and capacities would be valuable to bring in at a board level to make sure that the board is also able to fully engage with the opportunities and the direction that Smart Start's going.

41:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And on the open platform vision, the Report mentions Smart Start's transitioning toward open platform orchestration. What does that mean from a governance standpoint?

42:00 - Carley Furness-Symms
I mean, if you could tell me what that means from a pragmatic standpoint. I'm not quite sure I fully understand what open platform orchestration means anyway, but what I will say is it's maybe linking to the conversation, the part of the conversation earlier where the board has had to continuously evolve the way we think the Smart Start opportunity, the way they think Smart Start is going to reach the objective of a million children and access. So I suppose for the board, the question really is now is what is the role that Smart Start needs to play? Which pieces of the Smart Start infrastructure that have been built need to be retained and how, and how do we support other people benefit from what Smartstart has already built without having to rebuild it all themselves. That's my best explanation, but I wouldn't quote me on that.

42:44 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, thank you. I know you've touched on sustainability a couple of times. What needs to happen for Smartstart to be sustainable and impactful at scale over the next decade?

43:06 - Carley Furness-Symms
What needs to happen for Smart Start to be impactful and sustainable at scale over the next decade? Well, I mean, if you can answer that, then you've solved our strategic planning question. So many pieces of the puzzle. I actually can't answer that, because I think part of where it gets complicated is exactly what the modality of scale is going to look like, Because if the open platforms and infrastructure is where we're heading and we're resolving there, then it's a whole different series of questions. But I mean, the big piece of the story for me is figuring out the different funding streams of sustainability for the practitioners, the various mechanisms put in place for quality assurance and ensuring they're tech-enabled, streamlined and able to happen at the lowest cost, the lowest sort of cost of time, effort points as well. The quality assurance mechanism has to be ready to roll out in the most cost effective and nimble way as possible. So those are big pieces of those puzzles, but those are all puzzles that if we shift the way we're doing it are going to also not just be smart start, but it's going to have to be in conversation with the ecosystem. So I don't have a good answer for you. I think these are the questions we're grappling with at the moment.

44:26 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much. Thank you for your insight again. I'm handing it over to you.

44:30 - Lungiswa
Okay, I think Carley will be happy to know that we are almost at the end. So in regards to just your closing reflection, you've given us amazing reflections. As you reflect on 10 years, the past 10 years, what are you most proud What's the one or, I mean, you can say more than one thing that you're most proud of

45:13 - Carley Furness-Symms
That the gamble worked. I think when we were selling the idea of Smart Start to our board, to our funders, to everybody, it was just an idea. I think I'm most proud of the fact that actually it's something that just started as a, well, it's an opportunity to take. It has really grown as much as it has and landed where it has. And it's been far more impactful in ways that I hadn't expected. And I'm so proud of that as well. Yeah, I mean, I think that's probably just from a personal perspective is that the risk really paid off. And actually, the investment has paid off. Even if we were to stop right now, which we're not going to, certainly just from sitting it out, the risk has paid off. It's been worth it. It's been impactful. It's been transformative. It's done far more for the sector than we even realized it would. Yeah, I'm proud that we've appointed the right CEO. I think Grace has been the right CEO to take this opportunity. And grow it the way it has. I think one can't underestimate just how much she has done and her role has been in making this work and building the right teams around and keeping the engine going. So that's something else I'm very proud of, that we selected the right CEO and she's been fantastic in what she's done. Yeah, I'm very proud of that. I'm very, very, I think, of where Smart Starts landed in just the way in which it engages with the network. I've just been so deeply impressed with how so many members of the Smart Start team, when I talk to them, really are listening, the practitioners, listening to the Smart Starters. They're not coming at it from a conceptual, we know the answer, but they're really wanting to hear and test in their network and find the answers and engage with the partners I think it's such a deeply respectful way in which to work with people that I've been deeply impressed. And even as Smart Talk gets bigger and bigger, there's consistently that value and that acknowledgment that the power lies with the practitioners on the ground. And actually, we have to be listening to them and to their network. And we have to be responsive to what's coming up from the ground. And I've been very proud of the way that they've often done this. I mean, we don't always get it right, that they keep going back to. Yeah, I think those are the main things.

47:50 - Lungiswa
Great, thank you. In terms of the key message, if you could say one thing to all the important stakeholders that you work with, so your funders, government partners and just the whole Smart Start network in this particular Report, what would it be?

48:17 - Carley Furness-Symms
We're sending something to the effect of, you know, let's not stop now. We've shown ourselves what we can do. We've really shown ourselves what the possibilities are. And now's not the time to tamper our ambition and to tamper and to sort of step back. Now's the time to push even more. We're just at the cusp of really taking this and making this something totally transformational for our nation. So I just think, yeah, I think it's good to sit back and just congratulate and be proud of where we've gotten to, but it's the time to lean in again. Let's not step back from our ambition. Our goal is now let's push in. Now's the time to take the big risk. Now's the time to push hard because we are really starting to unlock things now. And I think this is an exciting new phase we're going That's all from my end.

49:13 - Lungiswa
I'll let Voulet take you through the last two questions and then we'll wrap up. Thanks, Carley.

49:20 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thanks, Jacqueline.

49:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you, Ligny. Thank you, Carley, again for sharing. Okay, the last section is titled, really, rather dramatically, The Narrative Arc. The three powers, the Report is structured around three powers, over 24,000 time, the platform that enabled them and 15,000 current practitioners creating impact. Does this structure capture this much thought story as you see it from a governance perspective?

49:53 - Carley Furness-Symms
I mean I think so, I mean I think my reflection, one of my reflections was when you first asked me, somewhere along the line I said some to the fact that actually the board, we first and foremost recognize the smart starters as the power of the network. So the framing seems to be around that. Yes, it's actually, that is the power of the network and smart start on the hub is the enabler, but the power really is the woman mainly and some men practitioners in the network. So it seems if I'm understanding the three things that you mentioned, yes, then I would say yes.

And on evidence of impact, the 2023 evaluation provides evidence that Smart Start children outperform national averages. From a board perspective, what does that evidence mean for Smart Start's future and your ability to advocate for policy change?

50:57 - Carley Furness-Symms
sorry, what does the evaluation outcomes mean for our future? I suppose I feel like a little bit like I'm going to repeat myself, but because I think it's the same thing I said earlier, which is the power to actually demonstrate that quality lies in different modalities and different approaches, and really driving the agenda forward of actually trying to figure out what drives quality outside of our formal inputs, which is really, I think, where small-scale future lies is if we're going to get to scale and we're going to reach our ambition, we have to get everybody coming alongside that these different modalities and certainly home and community-based models are legitimate and are a quality way of delivering a service. So it's the same sort of framing I used earlier, I think.

51:45 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, then that's it from our end. Thank you so much for sharing. We've had you for almost an hour now. So I just wanted to inform you that this interview will form part of your board chair letter. You'll have a chance to review the draft before we finalise. And do you have anything else important that maybe we didn't ask that you might want to include?

52:14 - Carley Furness-Symms
No, I think probably what I'll do is once you've written it up and I get a sort of a sense of how it's landing, I'll give input there again.

52:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much again. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much. Thank you, Lumi.

52:26 - Carley Furness-Symms
Yes, thank you both.

52:27 - Unidentified Speaker
Thanks, Kali.

52:28 - Carley Furness-Symms
Can I ask you a quick question? Sorry, what's the time framing for all of this? When should I expect?

52:39 - Lungiswa
Probably mid-Feb, if I'm not throwing Lante under the bus. Mid-Feb, because we had some delays with starting the whole process but we've made substantial progress so yeah mid-feb right?

53:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yes, I think mid-feb.

53:02 - Carley Furness-Symms
Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.

53:05 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you.



Interview with Rebecca Hickman, 
Her title: chief ecosystem and policy officer
Date 4 February
Speaker 1
Okay, so just to get straight into it, we're going to start off with the ecosystem journey. When Smart Start started in 2015, what was the ecosystem landscape for early childhood development?
Speaker 2
That's a great question. So it was a very fragmented landscape. It's at a provider level. It was a very similar landscape to the one now, which is that there was this sort of what we call a quasi market of provision, whereby nearly all of your providers are independent providers. and some of them received subsidies from government. But in terms of the ECD sector that sort of surrounded those programmes, there was this very wide range of non-governmental organisations, resource and training organisations, what we call RTOs. And then organisations focused purely on training, community-based organisations that were trying to support ECD programmes in their area. So what you had was this very fragmented picture of NGOs, RTOs, CBOs doing amazing work, but each in their own pockets and not very well joined up. And that was part of the problem that Small Start came in to solve.
Speaker 1
Thank you. And about solving the problem. I think the next question gets right into it. Can you identify a moment when Smart Start decided it couldn't solve the ECD problem alone, that it needed an ecosystem approach? What triggered that realization?
Speaker 2
Oh, who made these questions? These are such good questions. I love them. I wonder if Tabo was involved. So I think on some level we always knew that at the start, right? And do you know what? Right at the start, before we'd even set up, we pulled together a group of leaders from NGOs already in the sector and asked them to help us design. So some of the very first meetings I was drawn into was with a set of six or seven CEOs where we were sitting around a table and we were brainstorming. We were sort of talking about what sort of program we need to deliver, what sort of organisational architecture we need to achieve our goals. And then of course, the architecture we chose was social franchising. The social franchising by definition shows that we, right from the start, we knew we couldn't solve this alone. Right from the start, we knew we had to do it in partnership with these amazing actors that were already in the system and that had deep experience, social capital and expertise to actually help us do it. I think Taking your question to a sort of second level would be, when we've realized that the power of the solutions is going to lie in elective ecosystem orchestration, that I think has been a growing realization over the last five to six years. So that it's not, it goes beyond all of the partnerships that we structure into our platform. through all of our different franchisors. And we have to look beyond that and say, how do we actually work really effectively and powerfully with all the other players in the system? And I think that has been an emerging priority for us in the last five years. And now as we go into our new industry period, it's going to be a real top priority.
Speaker 1
And keeping again with partnerships, walk me through the early days of building ecosystem partnerships. Who were the hardest actors to bring to the table?
Speaker 2
Oh, that's a great question. It's difficult to answer that question without naming organisations. And I know that's not what the question is getting at, because there are always organisations that have been in any sector for a long time and who are resistant to change and who are very resistant to new players. And Smart Start came in with a very bold ambition and with substantial backing. And that was always, and we were essentially A disruptor. And we weren't setting out to be a disruptor, but that's what we were because we were trying to do something so different within ECD. And so there were some organisations that were excited by that, wanted to sort of learn more, be part of the journey, and there was someone that was threatened by it and have resisted Smartstart and have kept resisting us. I think the other partner that was very difficult to bring to the table was government, because at that time ECD was led by the Department of Social Development. The Department of Social Development had a very narrow framing of early learning, which was more that it was sort of some sort of social welfare provision. They didn't well understand Smart Start despite our best efforts to meet with them and explain and look at how we could partner with them. So we had a very tricky early journey with trying to create alignment and a sense of sort of shared endeavour. with government. And that was before responsibility for ECD was transferred to the Department of Basic Education, because at that point, there was a massive shift in our relationship with government.
Speaker 1
And joining to that question, because you have sort of answered the next question that I had, it was centred around government. I think you've answered the first one. But can you describe a specific moment or conversation when the government relationship shifted from scepticism to partnership?
Speaker 2
I think probably not, because that's generally not how trust is built. It's built up through multiple conversations and engagements. What happened When DBE was preparing to take on the function, it convened a whole lot of sector conversations, the big online meetings that were attended by over 200 sort of organisations within the sector, and was trying to consult with the sector on what its hopes and expectations were with ECD moving to DBE. We took part in those and then towards the end, they asked a few leading organisations to present on their models and that included us. And as we were preparing for that session, it's sort of, it felt like there were some people preparing for that, wanted to sort of do it in a way that gave the competitive edge to their model. And that really wasn't government wanted. And we really, and we showed up in a different way. We sort of said, we want to try to describe a model, an approach that can work for all of South Africa. And I think through those conversations, we built a lot of trust with a couple of key people in DBE. who really liked the fact that we weren't just trying to promote smart start, we were trying to look at solutions for South Africa. And after that, I was able to have conversations with them. And from those conversations and the idea of me being seconded into government came up. And that was a gradual process of trust building. It was also, to be honest, there's always an element of luck around me. I just had an extremely good rapport with the people in government, including the chief director, Lula Melona. We just clicked. And sometimes it's actually something as simple as that. There's no sort of secret sauce. It's just the power of relationships.
Speaker 1
That's good. Okay, let's move it a bit to your role evolution. Your title is Chief Ecosystem and Policy Officer. How has your role evolved over the past decade as Smartstart's ecosystem strategy matured?
Speaker 2
I mean, my role has been very non-linear, so I began being... I came in to do consultancy right at the start on programme design. And then on models of replication, I conducted a literature review on different models of replication. From that, I then started sort of getting involved in helping to sort of build some of the systems, like some of the tools that were needed to now actually put this into field. And I was mostly working with Justine Jowell, and she was very much, I mean, in the lead until Grace was appointed. But even when Grace was appointed, I still was working to Justine and supporting on everything she was doing to try to build the systems to put into field. So I helped, for instance, design our child monitoring And I, there's a lot of work on our programme quality assessment tool. And then a couple of, not probably, in 2016, one thing that Grace got early on that other people didn't get, and I always say that this, This is one of the most, this has been one of the most significant factors in the Smart Start journey is Grace's ability to see how incredibly important it was us to engage with the regulatory environment that our programs had to work in. And Like I think our board at the time was saying, No, no, no, that's not your job. Your job is to deliver a programme. Just, you know, deliver the programme. We've got other organisations like Alifa Levantuana. They'll lobby on the regulatory environment. They'll try to get better policies in place. And Grace's view was that you've had to bring that deep understanding from the ground to be able to inform a more enabling regulatory and funding environment. And because all of our programmes are expected to register, and yet the way that the processes and standards for registration were far, far out of reach programmes in low-income communities. And the regulatory framework was completely inappropriate for our context. So from 2017, from 2016 actually, I started working, and this took me back to actually where my career had started. I know this isn't really about me, but just because it seems like a bit of an odd leap. I had always previously worked on legislative reform for public policy. And so I started looking at the Children's Act and at the norms and standards and at the regulations and going really deep into them and developing proposals for reform and not sort of high level proposals, but literal line by line proposals for what needed to change and the whole reconceptualizing of the sections of the Children's Act that deal with ECD. And that, Grace's identification of that as being the critical lever for the future sustainability of our programs was absolutely spot on. And what it meant was that in 2022, when DBE took over, one of the main reasons why they wanted to second me was because they knew that Smartstart had invested in this deep analytical work. they knew that we'd actually become real experts on this and that we were marrying our deep operational experience with an analysis and set of proposals of legislative reforms that were needed. So I think so that, and so your question talks about the sort of the journey in terms of my current job title, ecosystem, and that really speaks to the policy piece, right? Because from about 2016, I was deeply focused on policy and then my work in government, when I was supported in those two years, was working very closely with them on things like the new Children's Amendment Bill. the whole red tape production work stream that was being co-led by DE and the presidency, and crucially drafting the new 2030 strategy for ECT programmes. So those were crucial bits of work that I helped to lead in government. So that was the policy bit. The ecosystem bit had In a way, all of that work is about the ecosystem, right? Because we weren't doing it for our smart starters. We were doing it for every practitioner in South Africa who is trying to run a programme in a low-income community. For every child in South Africa who needs to access early learning and childcare in their low-income community, those children deserve to have their context seen and respected in the regulatory framework. in order that they could access the types of quality opportunities that children in wealthy communities were able to access. And so it was, these were all, and our framing of this recent, over the recent years has been very much this, that these were all ecosystem solutions we were trying to build. We weren't building solutions for Smart Start, we were building solutions or for the whole ecosystem.
Speaker 1
That's really insightful, Rebecca.
Speaker 2
Oh, you're on mute?
Speaker 1
Oh, oh, oh, sorry. I'm muted because of the dogs. That's insightful. I'm enlightened. So the next question focuses on the ECD Outcomes Fund. The ECC Outcomes Fund is described as a game changer. Tell me the story of how that came to be. What had to happen behind the scenes to make it real?
Speaker 2
Okay. First of all, we had to convince the, so the ECCE Outcomes Fund is part of the Education Outcomes Fund, which is this big global initiative. And the first thing we had to do behind the scenes was to convince them to focus on preschool education, which wasn't a priority for them five years ago. And I met with them about five years ago. I actually met with them in London. And then they started then showing interest in South Africa as a place where they could sort of test approaches around preschool education and started building the relationships with the necessary government people. So, I think that was the first thing was that we, were we were part Smartstart part of the conversations with the EOF to convince them to have a stream that focused on early learning. I think The other thing that we really had to do to make that happen was what was the model that they originally wanted to come in and do was work with NGOs to build quality and programs. And we lobbied over a period of at least a year to say that's not good enough. That's not a game changer. You have to come in to look at how you can fund NGOs to create substantial new access and then absolutely build quality. But coming in to fund, you know, we know there are brilliant NGOs in South Africa that help to build the quality and whatever exists. Like we don't need an outcomes fund to come in to run expensive evaluations at the far end and tell us that. They maybe give us insight into which ones are most effective and which aren't. But actually, that's not the dilemma that South Africa's facing at the moment. That's the old Global North type perspective to bring to the Global South. We were saying, if you're bringing an equity, if it first and foremost, we're concerned about equity and this fund must prioritise access. And we prevailed in that argument and they divided the funds so that it's so that half a bit focused on access and half focuses on quality. So I think we had to be really prepared to hold our ground on it. And I think in the subsequent negotiations, the negotiations have been incredibly detailed and challenging. We've had to be prepared to stand on the ground of our experience and really speak with authority into how the fund is designed and developed. And that hasn't always been easy. It's been a real learning curve for the EOF team, the South African government and for us.
Speaker 1
Thank you for that. Just to focus again on government. You work with government at both national and provincial levels. What's different about those relationships? Can you give an example of a provincial partnership that shows how Smartstart operates locally?
Speaker 2
I guess in terms of the different responsibilities of different spheres of government, The responsibility sits with national government to work out the policy, legislative and funding framework for provincial government to then implement. So our work with national government has really been trying to look at those big levers, which are policy, law and funding. In provinces, what we grapple with in our conversations with them is how to be then translate that into meaningful delivery strategies. And what does provincial government's role look like in that as they partner with an organisation like Smile Sturge? And so provinces are at the sharp end of things like having to implement a mass registration drive, for instance, which is this big government initiative to try to get all ECD programmes registered. You know, they have the operational teams in the field trying to make these things happen. And so we are looking at how we support that work and different forms of collaboration. I think one of the things that is obviously very different about working with provincial government is we have 9 provinces and they are all very, very different. They have different political complexions, they have different capability levels, and they have different ideas on how to go around executing their responsibilities, go about it. We can't use a template approach. We can't sort of impose the same template on every province. We have to understand where they're at, what the particular challenges are, what the particular opportunities are. And it's not easy. It is It's difficult. I mean, after this meeting, I'm going straight into another meeting, which is around how we contract with Northern Cape. And this stuff is really at the sort of the business end of how to do delivery well. and what public-private partnerships looks like for that. And I think we're still learning and provincial government is still learning and it's sort of it's going to be our sort of key priority for this next strategy phase.
Speaker 1
Okay, thank you, thank you for that. You touched on about some of the work that you've done in the past. What policy shifts over the past 10 years are you most proud of? What took the longest to achieve? So sorry, what policy shifts over the past 10 years are you most proud of? What took the longest to achieve?
Speaker 2
I think, I mean, it's probably the same answer to both. And that is government recognising the crucial importance of home and community-based programmes. And for so long, government has been fixated on ECD centres, the sort of shiny, purpose-built sort of mini schools model of early learning. And In some communities, you know, those exist and they provide wonderful opportunities for children. But there's a problem with that fixation. The first is that it doesn't allow, it doesn't really understand what the ingredients of quality are in early learning, because the ingredients of quality are not about a shiny building. They're about the interactions between the practitioner and the child. They're about the opportunities for children to explore, to learn, to problem solve, to practice language, to listen to stories. And so many of those things, to be honest, require no building at all. We see in other African countries that happen under a tree. And they all help to shift outcomes for children. So when we're fixated on what the building looks like, we miss actually where the magic of early childhood development happens. And that happens through the experiences and the interactions. trying to persuade government that that was the case, including after the function had shifted to the Department of Public Education, because the minister then, Angie Mosheka, was also absolutely fixated on just building whole loads of early learning centres. And so we need to try to win that argument with her. We didn't actually come at it by arguing the quality piece first. We argued the pragmatism because this is the other problem with focusing on China news centres. We can focus on trying to build those centres and essentially what we're saying is that today's children won't get access because there is no funding to build those centres and the lead in time, if there was, would be, you know, many, many years for that level of infrastructure to be built across the country. So we're basically going to deny another generation of young children any access. And that was the point we kept pushing with the minister. And she gradually pivoted. And it was an extraordinary thing to be in those meetings over the space of the year and to watch her go on her own journey of realising that actually, this wasn't about creating a mini schooling sector. It was about how we leveraged the rich resources that already exist in even our lowest income communities to create new early learning, quality early learning opportunities. And I think I think getting government to buy into that, getting government to buy into the fact that home and community BF-based early learning is an immediate, affordable and pragmatic solution, but that it's also a quality solution. It's not a second-tier solution, it's a first-tier solution. I think that is one of our proudest achievements of the last 10 years, because that was absolutely not what government believed 10 years ago. And yet we then helped them to develop a strategy that gave recognition to that.
Speaker 1
That's good. What policy changes are still needed for early learning to work at population level scale in South Africa?
Speaker 2
So, we've worked with government on the Children's Amendment Bill, but it's not an act yet. So, I mean, we could say, well, we've done that, but we haven't done it since so far as we still need to support government, we're taking it through Parliament. So we need, we urgently need the Children's Amendment Bill to be passed into law. And then beneath it, what would be crucial would be the new sets of laws and standards that are developed. And those sets of norms and standards need to be enabling, need to be contextually appropriate, need to be inclusive. And that will be the real game changer is when we develop regulatory points into the regulatory framework that enable us to get funding flowing to the programmes that need it most as quickly as possible, because they can't get the substance until they're registered and they can't get registered because of the standards that are set in at completely the wrong level. So I think that's on the one hand. I think on the other hand, The other sort of policy change we need is more of a focus on early stage ELPs that are sort of, for whom registration is a way of, but they need to have sustainable livelihoods and the practitioners don't have sustainable livelihoods. And Smart Start provides stipends to much of our network. And we also are in partnership with a couple of different public employment programmes to provide stipends. But what we've pushed for is there should be a stipend programme across the sector that all practitioners can access while they are in their setup phase so that they're sustainable during that phase. before they get registered and then access the subsidy.
Speaker 1
Thank you, thank you. Again, I just want to refer back to the time. We need to keep it short so that we are done with the 28 questions. We are currently on Section C and the section focuses on real reform for ECD. Smart Start co-founded the Real Reform for ECD Coalition. Why? What was the problem you were trying to solve together that you couldn't solve? Why? And what was the problem that you were trying to solve?
Speaker 2
So we didn't found it. We were part of a group of organizations that came together to sort of catalyse it. But I certainly wouldn't say that Smart Stop founded Real Reform. We, the problem we were trying to solve there was that there wasn't a vehicle for mobilising the voice of practitioners so that they could actually advocate for themselves and that their voice was probably heard by policy makers. so that was the problem we were trying to solve and that real reform has stunning, incredible work in solving.
Speaker 1
And what has real reform achieved over the past decade? What's changed because what's changed because this coalition exists because of the exist systems of this coalition.
Speaker 2
It hasn't existed for a decade. It's just existed for the last five years. And I think I'd say the same thing. The thing that's changed is that practitioners are raising their voice in policy making. An example of that would be when there were parliamentary hearings on the Children's Amendment Bill, we arranged for perhaps a real reform and smart start to arrange for practitioners actually to give to give presentations so that their so that their voice could be heard. They sort of orchestrated campaigns and demonstrations. They also orchestrated really effective municipal level advocacy, so providing tools for practitioners to advocate to their municipalities on the changes that are needed locally. And so it's been a wonderful way of galvanizing practitioners in a purposeful way. so that they have the tools to enter those spaces authentically and powerfully.
Speaker 1
Okay, thank you. Can you share a story where Real Reform's collective advocacy succeeded, where individual organisations would have failed?
Speaker 2
I mean, it's never really as clear cut as that. And real reform wouldn't argue it is either. It's all about everybody doing their part. And the problem is that it's not only about success, it's about what's right. And it's not right for a whole load of NGOs to be constantly speaking on behalf of practitioners when practitioners don't have the opportunity to speak for themselves. So it's about creating good process and about democratising advocacy. And, you know, there's been so much sort of positive shifts in governments. approach to certain issues, government solution building around the Children's Amendment Bill, real reforms, workers played a really significant role in all of that. But I don't think they'd say their role has been decisive or more important than what other, it has been the power of us all playing our part.
Speaker 1
You touched on the next question that I'm going to ask. Coalitions are hard. What have you learned about working with diverse partners who sometimes have competing interests?
Speaker 2
But again, what have we specifically...
Speaker 1
What have you learned about working with diverse partners who sometimes have competing interests?
Speaker 2
I think it's always I don't think we do with competing interests. I would slightly reject the premise of that question. I think coalition building is hard because you have strong personalities with different ideas on how to, on what the right solutions are. And I think that what we've learned is that constantly coming back to the shared problem we're trying to solve, and the shared vision we want to achieve is how you create alignment. Because actually at the end of the day, you can have endless debates around why you disagree with, and let me bore you with these debates, you know, like the drafting in the Children's Amendment Bill or certain norms and standards. And you know, we have really, and it's great to have that disagreement because that's how you get really good thinking and outcomes. But I think what I've learned is that if you keep naming the shared problem and the shared vision, then you can realign even when you're sometimes disagreeing on some of the specifics.
Speaker 1
Okay, thank you. The next section focuses on ecosystem orchestration. As much as that's orchestration role, The strategic vision document talks about smart start moving forward, moving toward open platform orchestration. From an ecosystem perspective, what does that mean in practice?
Speaker 2
Are you doing an interview with Lasola as well?
Speaker 1
No, La. What did you say the name is La? No. Not with Lazola, but Justine. Oh, yes. we are going to do an interview with Justine.
Speaker 2
Okay. So just articulate that question again to me.
Speaker 1
Okay. Smart Start's orchestration role. The strategic vision document talks about Smart Start moving toward open platform orchestration. From an ecosystem perspective, what does that mean in practice?
Speaker 2
So I think what that means is new ways for other partners within the ecosystem to contribute to and get value from our platform so that we actually try to dissolve the hard edges of social franchising and we become social franchising plus so that there are more ways in which people can not people as much as a wide range of organizations and potentially smaller organizations can actually be in relationship with the Smart Start platform. But that's the ecosystem part of that, saying that we need new forms of participation in the platform. Because having such a fixed, standardized model isn't going to get us to scale. But what I would say, Tarbo, is that I think it would be really beneficial to have an interview with Lazola. I don't think Justine will be able to provide the insight on some of this thinking, which is very much being led by Lazola at the moment. And I think also because he brings such a fresh, decent perspective to some of this, I think you'd get some really good insights from him.
Speaker 1
Okay. I know I'm also looking better myself.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll arrange, I'll arrange with Lazola. I think mostly we wanted to figure out the historical aspect for it has to be for decided who else to bring in. Yeah, that makes total sense. Yeah.
Speaker 1
Okay. then our next question. For any learning to work at scale, who else needs to be part of the ecosystem? Who's missing from the table?
Speaker 2
I mean, I don't think there's anybody really missing insofar as I think we have our actors and ecosystem well backed and we see the value and importance of all of them. I think sometimes the actor that doesn't make enough attention is the parent. And I think that we've always realised that we can't just work at the supply end of access, we have to work with the demand. The demand is about actually building understanding amongst parents of the huge value of early learning and getting them to be demanding quality services within their communities. And so I think that, I think that Parents aren't missing from the table because this is known, but I think that actually the parents' perspective and one strand of work that Tabo's team is leading on is this societal narrative shifting piece, which is actually how we work with communities, with parents and families to shift narratives around early learning. And that actually until those narratives shift in a profound way, universal access will be difficult to achieve.
Speaker 1
Thank you. Can you give an example of how Smart Start connects ecosystem actors, where you made an introduction or facilitated A partnership between two other organisations?
Speaker 2
I mean, look, our network is doing that all the time. It's just how we work. It's this nexus of different relationships. So sometimes it's our franchisors that are doing the introductions. In fact, more often it is that because they know the other organisations that are active in their geographies. I think one way in which we're doing connecting, a very good example of that is the systems mapping conference that we held in October, and we had a hundred people in the room from across the ECD sector. We had some of our global colleagues there, we had government there, and we used it very intentionally, and crucially, we brought in practitioners and parents. And it was a two-day workshop and it was extraordinarily powerful. And many of the people in that room said they'd never been in conversations like those, where you had government, NGOs, practitioners, parents, global partners all around the same table, all grappling with the same problems and challenges and how to solve them. And I think we... We really took great joy from that event because that was exactly the type of connecting that we believe in and that we believe will help us to build more powerful solutions.
Speaker 1
Thank you. How does Smart Start decide when to lead a solution versus enabling others to lead? What's the decision-making logic?
Speaker 2
I think it's a really interesting question. It's an incredibly complicated question, which I can't answer in a few sentences. And if I was you, I'd ask that question of Lazola. That is what his department is grappling with all the time.
Speaker 1
Okay, not a problem. I've made a note of it. Okay, moving on. The focus now is on systems change. Smart Start's theory of change emphasises changing systems more than providing services. What does that look like in your work? Can you give a concrete example?
Speaker 2
I think a lot of the government worker systems change work, right? Because we're trying to change some of those government systems and those relate to They relate to law, they relate to funding systems, they relate to monitoring systems, data systems. I think all of that policy work is about systems change. I would say that what Smart Start's tried to do is give a wider framing of what systems change is about, and it's not just about government systems. It has to be about the delivery system. And therefore, What Smart Start has set out to do is to solve for the part of the system that often remains unsolved for, not only in South Africa, but around the world, which is what is an at-scale delivery system for quality early learning. And that is basically a part of everybody's day job in Smart Start. That's what we're all engaged in, is building that quality delivery system.
Speaker 1
And on measuring systems change, how do you know when you are succeeding at systems change versus just delivering a good program? What's the evidence?
Speaker 2
I mean, I think that's a great question. We're still working out what we want our indicators to be for that. I think that What you do is that you look at the total number of children being reached in the system, not just the number of children being reached by your program. You look at the Thrive by Five index and is it improving? Because if the Thrive by Five index isn't improving and that's showing outcomes for our five-year-olds, then we're not clearly not shifting the system in the right direction. So you basically have to look at ecosystem-wide indicators. And that would then also include, have we built an enabling and inclusive regulatory framework that is ensuring that programmes are sustainable in even our lowest income communities? But I think systems change indicators encourage us to look outwards rather than to sort of use our own reductionist.
Speaker 1
And what are the biggest barriers to system level change in South Africa's ECD landscape? And what keeps you up at night?
Speaker 2
I think the biggest barriers are the ones that I've referred to, which is how you solve the early stage of an early learning programme for its sustainability before it is registered. And we see significant attrition still in our network that we do lose a lot of programmes. And so much of that just has to do with the fact that in those early stages, they don't have a sustainable livelihood. And when you live in that level of poverty, you don't have the luxury of running something that doesn't give you a sustainable livelihood. And that needs to be solved for systemically. That is the piece that government tends to focus on registration subsidy and afterwards, but not at the early stages and the life cycle of an early learning programme. Yeah, that's where we see the biggest barriers.
Speaker 1
And who has surprised you as an ally or partner over the past decade?
Speaker 2
I mean, look, I mean, I don't know if we can put this in the linear report, but we'll see. But I mean, I'd say government has surprised me. I have just been so pleasantly surprised by their desire to collaborate, their desire to do collective problem solving, the humility that they've often brought into conversations, the quality of the people that we have, not only in DB, but in Treasury and in the presidency. Some really amazing officials in role. And it's made me feel deeply optimistic. when you see that quality of person working at the heart of government.
Speaker 1
In looking forward, specific and concise, the next decade, from an ecosystem and policy perspective, what needs to happen by 2035 for South Africa to have a functioning early learning system for all children?
Speaker 2
We need We need funding solutions for practitioners and funding solutions for the crucial functions that are performed by platforms like Smartstart. And we call those like the invisible costs that government doesn't, isn't currently seeing and paying for. But that is what is urgently needed. Along with those the early stage solution.
Speaker 1
Thank you. As the ecosystem matures and more actors get involved, how does Smart Starts Rule need to involve? What do you need to stop doing and start doing?
Speaker 2
I think we just we need to show up as an as. as a player that wants to play at the heart of the ecosystem, not somebody who wants to plough our own. Is that the term? Plough our own? But yeah, we need to show that we are trying to build solutions for the whole ecosystem rather than trying to build our organization.
Speaker 1
Okay. If you could wave a magic wand and change on policy or regulation tomorrow, what would it be and why?
Speaker 2
I think it would be stipends for practitioners that have set up programmes.
Speaker 1
Okay, and final three questions are just about reflection. When you look back over the past decade, what ecosystem or policy achievement makes you most proud? I feel like you touched on this also.
Speaker 2
I think I asked, I think I answered that earlier. Yes, you did.
Speaker 1
Yeah, you did. Okay, and then on learning, what have you learned about building ecosystems and influencing policy that you wish you'd known in 2015?
Speaker 2
You have to be patient. I'm not a very patient person. And yet you can't, like, they said that progress moves at the speed of trust. And trust building is often slow. But you really, there are no shortcuts. So I think, I think I wish, I wish I'd... Probably on some level, we didn't know that in 2015, but we still wanted the shortcuts. And for us now, I think we're really focused on the importance of trust building and relationship building.
Speaker 1
Thank you for that. And finally, if you could say one thing to the broader ECD sector government, NGOs, funders, academics about what it takes to achieve change at scale, what would it be?
Speaker 2
The multiplication is very different to addition. And what you've constantly got to be looking for is what are the accelerators within the system that you're building that are going to result in nonlinear change? Because otherwise one keeps just building an organization that's actually engaged in steady growth. And that's not what we're trying to do. We've got to close the access gap with steady growth. You need a massive acceleration. And sometimes that's therefore about subtraction. You know, people say scale is a subtraction game. And I think that that's one of the things in Smart Start we found hardest. And I found hardest because I helped build a lot of the early staff that actually now, in order to reach scale, we need to simplify and reimagine in order to create the type of acceleration we need.
Speaker 1
Thank you so much, Rebecca, sorry. Your perspective on ecosystem building and policy change is central to telling the smart start story. Thank you again for making the time insightful. It's just rich. I think you are helping us tell a clearer, better story. Thank you so much for your time.
Speaker 2
Well, I'm so pleased it was helpful. Good luck with this. It's not an easy task. I'm very much looking forward to seeing what emerges.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.
Speaker 2
Thank you. Have a lovely day.
Speaker 1
You too. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you, Tabo. Thank you.
Speaker 2
Cheers, Tabo. Bye. Take care. Bye-bye.
Speaker 1
Ooh.

It's Vuledzani Zhoi Itwao, meaning carry on what we have done. So Itwao is my twin brother.
1:12 - Mameetse Sebesho
Now it makes sense.
1:15 - Unidentified Speaker
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
1:20 - Unidentified Speaker
And it's nice to meet you.
1:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
As you know, we are, I work for Auxeira, and we are currently in the process of writing the Smart Starts tenure Report. And we would like to hear your input. You've built the system that supports 15,000 practitioners through coaches and training. So we want to understand how you developed that infrastructure, what you've learned and how it's evolved. So we have maybe 19 questions.
2:03 - vuledzani Tshivhase
We have 19 questions and I see that we are this meeting is for an hour but I would also just like to ask if we could record the meeting for Interview writing, Report writing purposes and reporting from our side. So please try and be very specific and very concise at the same time.
2:34 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Are you ready?
2:37 - Unidentified Speaker
What kind of Interview is this?
2:45 - vuledzani Tshivhase
It's a moving back, looking back type of Interview, reflecting back on the things that you guys have done and the work that you've done in the lives that you have touched and influenced. Yeah, so it's not difficult. But if there's anything, we can always come back to it and you can maybe email me some of the things that maybe you might not have right now. So that's okay.
3:19 - Unidentified Speaker
Are you ready?
3:21 - Mameetse Sebesho
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
3:27 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, so just to look at the role and system overview. As training manager, what does your role encompass? What are your responsibilities? For building and maintaining?
3:43 - Mameetse Sebesho
Okay, my role, you know, I don't know whether you are aware of this, but my role starts from recruiting, recruiting trainers. We do our own recruitment as the training team and after that I do training of the trainers and I do quality assurance.
4:05 - vuledzani Tshivhase
How did you come to Smart Start and to this role?
4:15 - Unidentified Speaker
What drew you to the early learning and training?
4:32 - vuledzani Tshivhase
learning and training?
4:36 - Mameetse Sebesho
I am a teacher, a primary school teacher, so I have been teaching for more than 15 years before I heard about SMART Start. So, as you know about the challenge that we have in South Africa of children who cannot Read and write by a certain age. So, I was interested in where the challenge is starting because, you know, in Grade 1, used to be a Grade 1 teacher, if children who can't Read or write. So I wanted to understand their lives before this. Then that's how I got to SMART Start. But I initially started by registering, you know, pay ed honours in ECT, just to have an understanding of what, you know, the challenge and how I can support. So, and then I met SMART Start and I've been here for the past 10 years.
5:32 - Unidentified Speaker
Thank you for sharing.
5:34 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And our next question, walk me through how a smart starter moves through your training system from first contact to becoming a confident practitioner. What are the key touch points?
5:50 - Mameetse Sebesho
You know, I had a question for you to say you're aware of our village and I did not get the answer.
6:01 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, you can just talk on it.
6:02 - vuledzani Tshivhase
It's okay.
6:04 - Mameetse Sebesho
Yeah, there's a process, you know, that happens. There's community engagement, you know, and we have what we call franchisors. They do community engagements just to go to communities and speak to people about this in a movement that we are doing.
6:23 - Mameetse Sebesho
people go through what we call mission day. Mission day, that's where they do activities. It's like an assessment, but not a proper assessment. It's an assessment through activities where we get to see whether these people can work with children, how resilient they are. And we also do criminal records checks, you know, just to check whether they don't have any criminal record. And then later we will do a check that checks whether their names do not appear in the child protection register. It's like the ECD requirement, you know, it's the sector requirement. So by the time we receive them in training, we will really know that these people can work with children, they are patient with children, they have the grit and they are are sort of resilient. So what we do in training, we call the training team like, we call ourselves transformational trainers. And the reason why we say this is because after five days, because the first set of training is five days, after five days, they get transformed. So the whole training programme is about, you know, the first five years child, and our training is quite reflective. They also reflect on their lives, the way they were raised, the way they've raised their children, and they look forward to changing that. So it's also about making them aware of the challenges that are in South Africa. You know, all the challenges that are in South Africa across the sector, you know, the fact that some children cannot Read, the fact that some children find themselves in the streets and not doing anything. So that's what makes them to be driven and to feel like they want to make a difference. So that's our first touch. And from there, there's a coach network. That's why I wanted to ask whether you are aware of the coach network.
8:39 - Unidentified Speaker
When we leave them after five days When you leave them after five days of training, there's a proper handover to the coach.
8:48 - Mameetse Sebesho
And the coach sits at the front. So the coach, there's the chance 90% the coach might have met this particular person when they were doing community engagements and also at Matching, because the Matching day, they are run by the coaches. So after the five days of training, we now hand them over over back to the coaches. And now the coaches, like, continue. And then trainers are very instrumental in parts of the training. After three months, we meet the group again for what we call the child progress training. The child progress training is now about checking, okay, now you have started your programme, you have been working with children for about three months, let's see how the children are progressing So basically, the temporal restraining is about that. And after that, they now do, we also meet with them again in terms of the business sustainability to say, you have been operating, now let's check how you, you know, let's work together on how to capacitate you on making sure that your business is sustained. And somewhere in the value chain, we do what we call silver registration. This is actually dependent on them, the franchisees, because if they register for bronze earlier, they can do silver registration any time on the failure chain. It's not time dependent. It's also, it's driven by where, the level where the franchisee is. So if the franchisee register for bronze after three months, they can do silver registration just after child hopeless. So those are the training programs that we do. And to be honest, we see the growth in them. We see the resilience in them. We see the change in them. I mean, the best point of change is just after five days, you know, when they get their starter licenses. These are just the licenses to show that, okay, in terms of skills and attitude, you now qualify. And also we do they do pre and post assessment tests, you know, after that, you know, we give them the starter licence to say, now you are ready. So that's where we get to see the mindset shift, you know, the mindset shift and the drive to start something new and to make a difference. And when we meet them after three months, after they shall have converted and have started working with children, you know, they challenge us. The challenges all over the time. So by the time we meet them at the business sustainability they actually challenge us because remember they live this life of running their small businesses and making profit or just meeting the challenges that are in every startup business. So that's that.
11:54 - Unidentified Speaker
Thank you, very insightful.
11:57 - vuledzani Tshivhase
So French Franchisees are smart starters.
12:02 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, franchisees are smart starters. I don't know, can I switch off my camera? No problem, no problem. Not a problem, I'll do the same. Yeah, it's stable. Okay, okay.
12:19 - vuledzani Tshivhase
So, then this next question ties very well with what you were saying. Over 10 years, you've trained thousands of women. Can you share a story of one smart starter whose transformation really stayed with you? What changed for her?
12:43 - Mameetse Sebesho
I just need to make a disclaimer here that much as I am the trainer manager, I don't do training.
12:54 - Unidentified Speaker
of the franchisees. I do quality assurance of the franchises. So the stories that I'm going to share are not other stories that I've had.
13:02 - Mameetse Sebesho
You know, I did not experience that.
13:05 - Unidentified Speaker
Those are the stories that I have shared.
13:11 - Mameetse Sebesho
So when, yeah, when we were in Tawu, maybe you were in Tawu, you were not there. Someone from your department was there. When we were at the week of the us last Year, because we were celebrating 10 we decided to just Interview the trainers that have started with Smarter Drive from the beginning. Some have joined before me, a Year before me. So what they shared was very emotional because one trainer who is based here in Gauteng shared a story of their participant who came the first day of training, she looked like she was not in. She looked like she just came because someone else told her about the training. But around Thursday, she said she had a conversation with this particular franchisee, potential franchisee, to say, are you in or are you out? That person was like, no, I'm in and look, I'm going to make this a success. And, you know, because sometimes people do not come across as serious, even if they are serious, you know, people are different. So that trainer shared with us that after a Year, she met this person. Actually, the person called her and said, you know what, I just want to tell you that I have six children. I have 16 children and I have employed someone. And after three years, she said she met this person at the mall. And this person was like, look, I now have an E-City Center. I now have an E-City Center. I have five employees under me and I'm impacting a lot of children. So, you know, that story, you know, made me see the value of the work that we do Sometimes we meet these people in training. We never really check their growth, but their growth is actually experienced by the coaches because we hand over to the coaches. We just hear these wonderful stories, but we never really meet them. So that is the first story. So the second story was with this lady from Pretoria who also didn't, was like, no, you know, when you meet these people, because we are human as well, you get to see that this one doesn't look serious. But once you start having one-on-one with this person, you start to see that, you know, this person is in, you know, their heart is in, it's just that, you know, their lack of resources and end. So I met that person while I had visited, because quality assurance, I do it for two to maximum of three days. So I had visited them I met her and I could also see that she was like, you know, it's just too playful. But last Year I met this person at the silver registration training and she was like, look, here I am and I have studied and I'm also even asking for a slot because I want to encourage these people. I just want to tell them that the first Year of starting a business is not easy. And it's not easy, not because you don't have systems in place, but because, you know, maybe the community, the community that you live in is not ready for you. Maybe the parents, you know, they don't understand. So it's a lot. There's a lot of mountains to climb in the first Year. But we gave her that slot and she encouraged everyone. So it was it was beautiful.
17:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Good insight. OK, our next question. Focuses on franchisor partnership. Smart Start works through franchisors to reach communities. How does that model shape your training approach? What do franchisors enable that central training couldn't do? What do franchisors enable that central training couldn't do?
17:31 - Mameetse Sebesho
This is very interesting because as we are in the stage of re-imagining Smart Start, we are also going to, we are thinking about testing other things that I shouldn't be speaking about anyway. But maybe let me just share that we have some franchisors who have training tips. We have training teams and we Interview the potential trainers, we train them, we accredit them as co-trainers and lead trainers and we do quality assurance on their trainers. So we have designed the trainer accreditation process that maintains the quality of the trainings that we do, because MASTAD is about quality. And the quality, you might have great material, you might have great resources, but if the trainer does not align to the quality that you have and is not trained well, we might not get what we want to achieve. So what we are doing, the reason why we want hold this quality assurance is because we want to maintain the quality that we speak about. And we are different as an organisation, we are different as SMART Start. Start is a different programme compared to a whole lot of other programmes that are out there. Remember, I'm paid to sell SMART Start, so I'm going to even sell it to you.
19:12 - Mameetse Sebesho
So we believe that, you know, if people are trained well, just like in the military, people have to be trained well and to be given the right resource for them to do that. So what we do with the franchisors is we have the—you know, Smart Start has a bigger MOU with the franchisor, but we also have the trainer MOU, like SLA, Service Level Agreement, with the franchisor with regards to their trainers. So—and this basically is about, okay, how we would work with your trainers. We have to intervene them. We have to do training of the trainer. And the training of the trainer does not mean that you will, there's a scoring matrix that we use. If the trainer in training, even for the five days, we are not satisfied, the trainer will not be accredited to start working as a co-trainer. So there's a long process that we do, makes us different and that makes us to continue thinking about holding on the quality element of the training team.
20:25 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Mamu, again, as you are talking about quality, I think it would be a good time to also focus on quality changes, challenges rather.
20:36 - Unidentified Speaker
What are the biggest quality challenges across the network?
20:41 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And not just individual but systemic patterns and how have you built the training coaching system to address them?
20:56 - Mameetse Sebesho
Okay, I just want to say equality gets affected by multiple factors and depending also on the communities that we work in.
21:11 - Mameetse Sebesho
their quality can be compromised because of their language. Much as we have trainers who train in the local language but our material is in English and we have translated the material but you know still people still the communities that we work in people still feel like okay we we also want to do it in English and and even in their programs they want to I mean, to be honest, much as we are like advocates of the home language, but people still, our communities, they still, English is still a selling point, if I have to put it that way. Yeah, so it gives a lot of pressure to our franchises, you know, because they try to do it in English so that it can sell, because of the business element. Otherwise they would, I mean, parents, sometimes they even suggest that, no, no, we are happy with you, but throw in some English in it. So that's where we are. But another thing is quality gets compromised by the number of participants in the classroom. Sometimes when we work with franchisors, especially when we go to areas where they already know about Mustard, so the community members would want to come to the training, and even if we have systems in place to say maximum is 40, maximum is you know, in different programs, maximum is, you know, we have a certain number of participants that are expected, you know, sometimes it will be very difficult to retain them. And when it's difficult to retain them, we will make sure that, okay, we send another trainer, you know, an extra a pair of hands and also somebody who will support the training, but quality gets compromised there. And another thing is, another thing that can compromise quality, I mean, I don't want to be, to sound like I'm looking at other things and I don't want to look at self, you know, and it might be like the misunderstanding, you know, sometimes when trainers are learning some concepts, the quality can be compromised there, or maybe something of the things can be lost in translation. Because our dream of the trainers in English, then when they go to communities, some of the things might be lost in translation. That's what I think can compromise quality. But the systems that we have put in place is because we are scaling and we know that we cannot always, like as a quality authority, I can't always be there. We have put systems in place and those systems involve feedback giving such, you know, the trainers, they have to plan together, they have to give each other feedback and they have to Report. So we have what we call infilled Report template. They have to Report and they also have to rate themselves and rate each other. So there's a system that is there. And then we take that information and put it in our trainer dashboard. So that dashboard will tell us, even when we are at the office to say, oh no, Mameetse needs support on this, because in terms of content facilitation, Mameetse is struggling. In terms of knowledge, Mameetse is 100%, things like that. So those are the processes that we have put in place.
24:59 - Mameetse Sebesho
And another thing, you know, we have in the training team, we have three quality assurers, you know, that speak different languages and that can go and support trainings all over South Africa.
25:17 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that.
25:20 - vuledzani Tshivhase
When you think about Smart Starts training in 2015 2025, fundamentally changed?
25:31 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm laughing.
25:36 - vuledzani Tshivhase
What fundamentally changed, not just content, but the whole approach, delivery, duration, ongoing support, and quality assurance?
25:51 - Mameetse Sebesho
I like talking with the training team that they have designed the Smart Start programme together with their franchisees. You know, when we started, we did not have a curriculum, like that's number one in terms of the content, we didn't have a curriculum. And when we started, introduced things gradually, we just started with the five days program, like the first Year was about this master program, like the five days. And then after a Year, that's when we introduced sharp focus training. And then after two years, that's when we introduced business skills training, because you know, we could see that no, no, the skills of the business here, you know, they are struggling. And then now, we had to move the starting your own business and include the business skills right at the beginning and now develop business sustainability training. That's where we are. That's how the system has changed. But the duration, I mean, the whole duration of the training time is now nine days. It's now nine days. Five days when it was just set up and then we added child progress and business sustainability and the self-registration.
27:26 - Unidentified Speaker
So you asked something that I wanted to say and I now forgot.
27:32 - Mameetse Sebesho
What was the question again?
27:33 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, when you think about Smart Starts training in 2015 versus fundamentally 2025, changed?
27:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
not just content, but the whole approach, delivery, duration, ongoing support, quality assurance?
27:50 - Mameetse Sebesho
Yeah, when we started, we also didn't have that system of quality assurance. We just knew that we wanted to do quality assurance, you know, we would just go and observe and give feedback and go. So right now, in terms of the quality assurance, we have the structure and it gets introduced right from beginning, just after the training of the trainers, the first training of the trainers, the quality assurance systems and processes are introduced there. And we have what we call the trainer journey, you know, the trainer journey where there are multiple spots of quality that are continuously assured. So I checked for quality assurance. So right now, the quality assurance, we have a proper system that works and and it's introduced right from the beginning. In the past, it was not there. And we also have quality custodians. In the past, I was the only quality custodian. So now I have sort of a team of quality assurers. So in terms of the approach, the approach, I can safely say it has remained. It has remained because it's what makes mustards mustard. You know, the quality, the approach of the training the transformational training model, it's what makes us different. So there has been a lot of refining throughout the 20 years and also just putting some systems in place to make sure that quality is not compromised.
29:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what did you try that didn't I'm thinking.
29:54 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Oh, what innovations have you introduced?
30:18 - Unidentified Speaker
You know, I.
30:19 - Mameetse Sebesho
think it's not um no I can't think of anything now um that we introduced uh that didn't work I think you know the continuous refinement has actually you know made things work um in my work you know correctly or might not deliver the results the way we thought and then instead of taking it out we would refine it. So I can't think of anything now maybe maybe let's let's pack this question as we speak I'll think about something.
31:10 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay and let's reflect maybe on COVID How did COVID force changes that actually stuck?
31:34 - Mameetse Sebesho
You know, as a nation, we have learned it, but we went back to the nation.
31:44 - Mameetse Sebesho
But I think, you know, hygiene, you know, the element of hygiene in terms of the resources that we use in training and also how we encourage franchises to keep, you know, to be aware of hygiene as it has is actually all of us made us think differently around hygiene. And because of the feedback I think that we also received, because after COVID some of the parents, but it's a small percentage of the parents were like, no, no, I don't want my child to come back to your centre because you guys share a lot of toys. But parents, our parents, they don't know that we also want to teach. It's a social skill. Sharing is a social skill. It's intentional. Not giving children 100 toys, it's intentional. We want them to develop that social skill of sharing, because it's a skill that they have to do. But it also, you know, what helps us is how to prioritize hygiene, how to make sure that our space is super clean, our toys are properly cleaned and, you know, cleaned perhaps daily or weekly to make sure. And the kind of toys that can be cleaned, because some of the toys, you know, they can't be cleaned. So that has actually just taught us. And to also practise that as the training team, because sometimes, not sometimes, I mean, a lot of times, We don't teach by what we say. We also teach by actions. We have to keep our things clean. We have to show hygiene. Even when we demonstrate some of the great practices that we want them to learn, we make sure that we, you know, COVID, that registration, that temperature check, it's still there. That's cleaning of the child. It's still there.
34:02 - Unidentified Speaker
And it wasn't there before.
34:07 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you. Let's move now to the platform. Smartstart calls itself a platform. From your perspective, what does that mean?
34:18 - Mameetse Sebesho
It means a lot of things. For me because it's not only about training. This is business organisation now.
34:43 - Mameetse Sebesho
It means opening up an opportunity for partnerships to make sure that early learning is happening across the country.
34:59 - Mameetse Sebesho
That's my simple understanding.
35:02 - Unidentified Speaker
It's not just by the training, it's an organisational thing.
35:09 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, and then now we move on to barriers. What are the biggest barriers to delivering quality training and coaching at scale? What would break if you tried to double number of practitioners?
35:32 - Mameetse Sebesho
I'm not going to comment a lot on coaching, but I'm going to just comment on the And also communities, I'm just going to also speak about communities.
36:09 - Mameetse Sebesho
Thinking about doubling the number, I think it's doable in terms of the organisation, what the organisation would want to do, you know, it just needs proper systems to be set and also, you know, yeah, that can enable that. But the communities, the question that I always ask myself is, are communities ready, you know, for this? And also a little bit of fear around oversaturation, oversaturation of these things in communities, because much as we see the children are there, but these people, they also want to make profit and they want to make money out of this thing and they also want to grow. So that's number one. But coming back to us as an organisation, I think if we can put proper systems, especially technological systems in place, we can We can get there. We can get there. It's a work in progress.
37:20 - Mameetse Sebesho
If right now there can be an organisation that says, OK, no, in the coming four months, please train this 15,000 people, it will take a lot out of us, you know, to make that happen. It will change all the things. We are getting ready for that, but we are not really.
37:55 - Unidentified Speaker
Some of the things that I'm saying, maybe you shouldn't write them. How safe is what I'm saying here?
38:07 - Unidentified Speaker
Tam, are you listening? You should listen and say, hey. I am listening. My internet is not the greatest.
38:17 - Thabo Ramphobole
You go slow.
38:21 - Mameetse Sebesho
I'm like, I just said, I don't think we are 100% ready for doubling the number. But I'm like, I don't know. There are things that I don't know because it's organizational.
38:31 - Unidentified Speaker
It's not only training.
38:35 - Unidentified Speaker
It's not only training.
38:37 - Unidentified Speaker
I can say yes.
38:39 - Mameetse Sebesho
I can say give me two weeks. I can get trainers that I can sort of Interview and make sure that we send them to trainings. But there are also some systems that have to be put in place and it's organisational. So I hope you don't write this one. Just go and ask someone else the same question.
39:04 - vuledzani Tshivhase
We can, from our side, we can send you the draft Report and just have you confirm maybe some of the things that you said already. Do you still share these thoughts or you change your mind about this thing that you shared with us? So you can request that and we can send it to you before it goes for printing.
39:35 - vuledzani Tshivhase
So now to reflect on impact and measurement, how do you know the training system is working? What does impact look like, both individual transformation and system level outcomes?
40:00 - Mameetse Sebesho
We have what, for start-up, you know, which is right in the beginning, we have the pre-assessment. This is an assessment that they write on day one, and on day five they write the same assessment. So there is always a knowledge shift, which we are happy about, and also the fact that, you know, people I think the percentage of retention for the whole organisation, I think it makes us see that there's an impact. So last Year there was a study that was conducted in KZN, which was about, you know, just checking the children who started with SMART start. I think that can be a great reference for you as well, just to see how our children are doing, because it's not only about the franchisee, but it's also about the children.
41:09 - Mameetse Sebesho
So that study has proven that our children become ready for school and they do better, even in classrooms in primary school.
41:22 - Unidentified Speaker
And we also have our alum, We also have our alum results that shows that our programme, the whole programme is working well and it's developing children holistically.
41:35 - Mameetse Sebesho
And also our model, you know, the coach thing, you know, I don't know whether, you know, you will be able to put that into the Report, but, you know, the fact that the alum results have proven that our model is working and develops children holistically and also our coaches model is working because people who are getting coached, they do better.
42:01 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, thank you for that. And moving on, what are you most proud of in your work with Smart Start?
42:20 - Mameetse Sebesho
You know, in the past, when we started, when we were advertising the role of the trainer, we started by saying, no, no, we want strictly ECD, you know, people who have been part of ECD or at least who have done some ECD. And we also were very specific about, okay, this person should have a certain level of experience in facilitation. But throughout the years, we have, you know, taken people who do not have ECD experience, and they are doing very, very well. Some of our great trainers are people who do not, who, when they joined Smarstart a while back, they did not have ECD experience. Some, they even didn't have ECD experience and facilitation experience. My pride is when, you know, I journey with a trainer right from the beginning, right from Interview, and I do quality assurance. I see that, oh no, this person in terms of knowledge, ECG knowledge, content knowledge and content facilitation, this person is great. So that has been my pride.
43:37 - vuledzani Tshivhase
A great reflection.
43:41 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Looking to the future, as smart start transitions toward open platform orchestration, what does that mean for the training function? What needs to change?
44:05 - Mameetse Sebesho
I think, to be honest, the training would still function. You know, I don't think the training department will be affected a lot because, you know, and I'm just going to give an example of the universities. We have people who would prefer UNISA, you know, but we also have people who would prefer, you know, So I'm looking at it through that lens to say, yes, open platform people will be getting our materials or be implementing them. However, or maybe, you know, they'll have to Read about us a little bit. But, you know, the training. We will still have the people who prefer.
44:58 - vuledzani Tshivhase
To be to be trained like in person, And to reflect on feedback, how does feedback from smart starters influence the training or coaching you provide? Can you give an example of something that changed because of a practitioner's feedback?
45:25 - Mameetse Sebesho
I wish you can also Interview, like Justino I hope you are going to do it.
45:33 - Unidentified Speaker
We are going to Interview Justine.
45:35 - Mameetse Sebesho
Yeah, when we started, when Smartstart was started a while back, I think the business element of the organisation was not, was never part of the initial design, but it's the Smartstarters who designed the business model. Back in 2016, 2017, you know, in the very first Smartstarters Unite, one of the Smartstarters shocked us all when she was like, no, I'm charging 400 rand per child, like in 2017 or 2018, I don't remember. And that's when we were still thinking about, yo, it looks like this should be a business, this should be, you know, this should be a business because when it's started, it was not positioned as a business opportunity. So they, the Smartstarters, they designed this. They designed this thing. And I think another thing that was actually introduced by the Smartstarter, you know, informally is, okay, what are they have taken the club system to another level. When we first started to think about clubs, it was about, okay, how can they support each other? And now they have also put in the business element into it. Now they are buying things in bulk. As a group, now they have some stock files. They took that concept of stock file, bar and feather. To make sure that it supports their business.
47:32 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what makes it possible for Smart Start to support 15,000 practitioners? What would break if you tried to double that number?
47:41 - Mameetse Sebesho
Oh, are you not asking me this question for the second time?
47:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
No, no, no. This specifically for the number of practitioners. What makes it possible for Smart Start to support 15,000 practitioners?
48:03 - Unidentified Speaker
The focus here is primarily on the practitioners.
48:09 - Mameetse Sebesho
This one is not for the training team because we train and we don't support. Else are you going to Interview?
48:19 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Justine and so far the one person we've confirmed is Justine, we've interviewed Grace and Kylie and a couple of other people.
48:29 - Mameetse Sebesho
I think Justine, ask Justine this question because the coaching department and also the value chain, I mean she's the value chain head and it's the value chain that that keeps and maintains and sustains a smart status.
48:52 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, so moving on, can you share an example of a smart starter who innovated something in their practice? I think you've shared this with the lady who had already started to charge a fee, so 15, we're going to move on. So number 16 um you manage a team of trainers and coaches how do you build not coaches not coaches trainers only okay let me let me give it to trainers okay you manage a team of trainers great trainers Please say that again. OK, you manage a team of trainers.
49:46 - Unidentified Speaker
How do you build their capacity?
49:49 - vuledzani Tshivhase
What makes a great trainer in the startup model?
49:58 - Mameetse Sebesho
What makes a great trainer?
50:03 - Mameetse Sebesho
OK, and OK, building their capacity.
50:09 - Mameetse Sebesho
Right from the beginning, as I said, there's a five days. We spend five days with them as a, you know, just to do training of the trainers. But we also do what we call immersion. And, you know, this is what we have learned. And I think maybe let me also just answer the question that you asked to see what we tried and that didn't work. In the past, we would Interview trainers and train them and then send to the floor to do training. And then some people will be shocked and, you know, resign there and there. But what we have introduced is Imagine Programme. So the Imagine Programme, after being interviewed, once, you know, a communication has been sent to say you are successful at this level, then we explain that there's an Imagine Programme. An Imagine Programme is visiting as understanding our programme, like spending the whole day attending machine day and attending the start-up training, going there and observing and seeing how our training is. And then after this, imagine you now can come to this start-up training. So that thing, it's hard. We bought their capacity because now by the time they sign, by the time we are happy with them, they are also happy with our program and how we do things. They have seen it themselves. They've observed and they have seen it themselves. And continuous capacity, we have what we call the trainer gatherings. We have them twice a Year. We have one at the beginning of the calendar Year and the other one at the beginning of the financial Year, which is in August. So that's where we sort of have some reflections. And also we make sure that for every gathering that we have, there is some early learning capacity building, you know, because this sector changes all the time. And also as an organization, because we grow, there might be new things that we introduce. So there are updates. And also, you know, we make sure we become very intentional. And also as part of train a trainee and also as part of the training quality assurance, we have, you know, three learning sessions that are there, you know, that we do them online to make sure that, okay, what do they need capacity on? Do they need capacity in terms of facilitation? We do that. Do they need capacity in terms of some early learning concepts? We do that. Do they need capacity in terms of some requirements and then we do capacity in that. So it's continuous. Even if we have a group, our 90% trainers are associate, which means freelancers, but we engage them a lot. We engage them and we make sure that they are capacitated because they are the people who are selling mustard. If they don't know what they're speaking about, it can compromise the quality.
53:25 - vuledzani Tshivhase
To reflect on that standardisation, how do you balance standardisation ensuring every smart starter gets quality training with allowing for local context and franchisor adaptation?
53:48 - Mameetse Sebesho
We make sure that we have trainers across the country and we even in our facilitation we have a trainer guide like a proper trainer guide that gets you know updated as and when but we also have trainers that are based in communities that we work in not it might not even be in that community but that province or that region or that municipality so they contextualize that concept. They try very hard to contextualise, to make sure that this speaks to them. Some of the early learning principles that they're saying, they'll always remain like that. But the contextualisation around perhaps business, obviously, when I'm in Soweto, where they charge 800 rand, and when I'm in Singa, where they charge 50 rand, people have to contextualize those things. So they feel what usually helps us. And I'm also learning from the trainers, because sometimes when I say we have what you call pre-training brief that we share with trainers before they go on training, some would be like, oh, no, are you aware that in this community, the chief is the one who sets fees? Are you aware that in this community, they do one, two, three? So that's what that's what we are learning, we actually encourage them to contextualize. And that contextualization is a big, it's a big, it's a big thing that we continuously speak about because we don't want people to contextualize to, you know, for a trainer, we always make trainers aware that the training is not about you, it's about them. So whatever you contextualize and adapt and you know, examples that you give, they have to speak to them, not you.
55:54 - vuledzani Tshivhase
So, we have two more questions before we finish. So, the second last question is about working with lead trainers. You work with Bafana Ubane.
56:10 - vuledzani Tshivhase
and Raphalalani as lead traitors.
56:18 - Unidentified Speaker
Why are you not spelling Raphalalani well?
56:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Raphalalani.
56:28 - Unidentified Speaker
It's the L-A-L-A. But your tongue is not rolling. It's not. Why, why?
56:37 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I am partly, partly, partly vendor. You work with Bafana Gxubane and Mpho Raphalalani as lead trainers. What's that collaboration like, How do you divide responsibilities?
57:06 - Mameetse Sebesho
I just want to say having full-time trainers, it's very beneficial because they are like the ears and the eyes of the training team in the field. And they get to, they support a lot in developing other trainers. So, but their responsibilities are very different. Much as they do lead training, but they also have other responsibilities like Mpho is a qualified assessor and moderator. So, you know, she also does support in terms of the CETA work. So those are the other responsibilities that she is doing. And also in terms of the admin, the training admin, and also making sure that all the trainers have the right resources for the training. So she's responsible for that. So in terms of Bafana, Bafana is like our pilot, you know, every new thing that we want to, every new thing that we want to, we want to test. She is, I mean, he is, his, his, his title has changed. It's not just lead trainers, lead trainer and test the pilot, whatever, whatever, you know, for every training program thing that we want to test. He is the man for the job. And he's also very instrumental in the business mentoring that is done by the training team. So his responsibility basically is to go to the field, give us feedback, and then before we want to adjust or review, we use him to test those things. We go to the field together with him and then we come That's how his insights, he works closely with me, but also with design, to design and improve the training programme.
59:13 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I think my last question, you've touched on it when we spoke about COVID, but if there's anything to reflect on it, please do.
59:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
How did the training system adapt when COVID hit? What emergency notifications became permanent parts of the model? That is my last question. I know you touched on it, but if there's anything else, please feel free to share.
59:48 - Mameetse Sebesho
in terms of the number of, you know, things that we were keeping. And as I said, you know, the hygiene level was raised, you know, the health and safety.
1:00:19 - Mameetse Sebesho
And with the training team, coming up with a strategy on how to involve, you know, train and continue happening. You know, what are the things that we can do because we ended up having the current that the learning was not just for the training team, but for the organization. I mean, the fact that we decided to involve training nurses during COVID-19 as they are still truly grateful to the state to say, you know, Ms. Batch, you came up for us out of that, they were not looking for free and they were actually doing the things that they are and have resources to do that.
1:02:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much for your time, your title in the Report. And if you do have concerns about anything that you shared with I can't Read your section if they do quote you. All right. Thank you so much for your insight. I think it's so much trouble.
1:02:46 - Thabo Ramphobole
Okay, all right.
1:03:15 - Mameetse Sebesho
Thank you very much. I ask that before they publish they should send it to me so that I can just see.
1:03:24 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay all right thank you very much.






Interviewer: Thabisile Zuma
 Interviewee: Hopolang Selebalo , Advocacy Portfolio, Smartstart Headoffice, GP	
Contact: hopolang@smartstart.org.za	
Interview Tuesday 3 February 9:00 to 10:00																	
SECTION 1: SmartStart as a Systems Intervention (Core)
Q1. Defining the Platform Model
From your perspective, what distinguishes SmartStart from more traditional early childhood development programmes in South Africa? (To be captured shortly.)
Q2. What SmartStart Understood Early
Looking back over the past decade, what do you think SmartStart understood early on about scale that many ECD initiatives struggle with?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 (To be captured shortly.)
SECTION 2: Partnerships for Scale and Reform
Q3. The Government-Community Balance
SmartStart has worked closely with government and advocacy partners while remaining rooted in community delivery. From a systems point of view, why is this balance so difficult and why does it matter?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 I think translating policy intent into workable practice is a great thing. That’s why we contribute to the Children’s Amendment Bill, for example, and the DBE’s 2030 strategy — because we can surface real life through the trust that we’ve established with practitioners and communities, and bring lived experience into policy conversations.
I also think it’s a privileged space to be in, but it’s a difficult one. The tricky part, in my mind, is ensuring that you are not co-opted into government machinery. Your views and your advocacy remain yours. You need to stay true to your vision, your mission, and the realities that you see every day. The difficulty is being swayed — or co-opted — into sending something that doesn’t reflect what’s happening in real life.
I think another challenge is the slowness. The processes are slow. We’ve been at the Children’s Amendment Bill forever, and it’s quite a game changer as a piece of legislation. It’s especially important for early learning providers who are outside of the regulatory net — providers that haven’t been seen by government despite how many there are in informal settlements, townships, and rural areas.
So you have people on the ground dealing with day-to-day realities — year one, year two, year three, year four — while policy changes take a long time. There’s a challenge in translating those realities into policy while policy takes time to move. And then even once the Bill becomes an Act, implementation will still come with its own pains and challenges.
So for me, the difficulty is the threat or risk of co-option, and the slow chop between reality and government systems.
Follow-up clarification (rootedness in community delivery)
Thabisile Zuma: I hear you about navigating that complicated engagement or relationship with government, particularly as it relates to the bureaucracy and the slowness at which the wheel turns. But there’s also the reality that you are quite rooted in community delivery. Can you reflect on striking that balance, and some of the complications with managing it from a community delivery point of view?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 In terms of deep embeddedness in the workings of the programme and implementation, that is probably the lens that Lazola, or someone from his team, would provide best. I’m more “in between.” I interface more on the policy side with the grounded side than on the detailed programme implementation insights. So if you want deeper, richer detail on programme and platform delivery, Lazola would be better positioned to provide that.
Q4. The Intermediary Role
In your experience, what role do intermediaries or platforms like SmartStart play in translating evidence from the field into meaningful system-level change?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 I think we translate practitioner realities into evidence for policymakers — evidence they can engage with. SmartStart, and organisations like SmartStart, are privileged because of proximity to practitioners on a daily level. We ensure that invisible trust and invisible work become visible.
And it’s not just one thing. It’s not just ECD, or access, or early learning outcomes. In the broader universe, there’s women’s unpaid labour, compliance burdens, gender norms, labour rights — you surface so much. It’s not one small pocket.
One example is a conference/workshop I attended last year — the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) systems workshop. We were very intentional in that workshop not to just have people working directly in the ECD space. We brought in colleagues working in parenting support programmes, responsive caregiving, nutrition, and those sorts of areas. But we also brought in people we don’t regularly bring into the room — feminist organisations, gender rights groups, labour rights groups, unions — because those issues are part of the same ecosystem.
So I think that’s the role we play in system-level change: showing that it’s not a contained issue, and bringing in the broader ecosystem.
SECTION 3: Learning, Adaptability and Evidence
Q5. Learning Orientation as Essential
SmartStart has evolved significantly over ten years, shaped by lessons from the field. Why is this kind of learning orientation essential for population level solutions in early learning?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 (Not answered in the interview — Hopolang requested time to reflect and respond later via email.)
Thabisile Zuma: I’ll make a note to come back to this question and follow up.
Q6. Next Decade Imperatives
As the early learning sector looks to the next decade, what do you believe platforms like SmartStart will need to do differently to support inclusion, quality and scale?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 A principle that SmartStart has held for a long time — and that needs to carry into the future — is collectivism. Collectivism will get us further than isolated organisational work. Collaboration and collectivism are key.
That’s why we are part of Real Reform for ECD, and we recently became part of the Care Initiative hosted by Hector and Care. (The full name is something like the Childhood Advocacy, Research and Engagement initiative — Thabo has the full correct name.) The point is that it brings in the “unusual suspects” I was talking about: feminist organisations, unions, and others — because there’s recognition that we have to do this together, with shared language and shared leverage points.
We need to identify leverage points — what will tip the scales — and do that together. And we need to be clear about what platforms can enable and what requires state responsibility.
I also think we need to engage more deliberately with municipal and provincial systems — with an exclamation mark on municipal. That’s where the rubber hits the road, and that’s where things happen. That’s where organisations struggle, and where practitioners struggle.
And we need to hold the line on quality while remaining flexible to context. Quality can be delivered through different pathways. For example, the SmartStart programme delivers quality outcomes for children without requiring an NQF Level 6 qualification. It requires training, coaching and support. So we need open-mindedness about how quality can be achieved, not insisting that only one pathway is valid.
Q7. The Gender Dimension of ECD Platforms
SmartStart creates livelihoods for women as franchisors and SmartStarters, while enabling parents (predominantly mothers) to work. From a socio-economic rights perspective, why does this dual impact matter and how should platforms think about gender equity, not just access to early learning?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 This is the core of my work, and it’s what I’ve been surfacing through spaces like the ECCE systems workshop and the Care Initiative.
We can’t say we’re being true to gender equity if mothers or caregivers — predominantly women — don’t have choices and are held back by the fact that they have small children in their care. In South Africa, caregiving is primarily done by mothers, or another woman (a grandmother, aunt, etc.). Women are the duty bearers of children, often in single-parent households.
A woman can’t go to work if she has a child to take care of. You have to do mental gymnastics: if I don’t have access to care, how do I get to work? And linked to that is affordability — can you even pursue work or study if you can’t afford care?
So women need options: access, availability, and affordability of care.
On the other side, the people providing that care — this is work. It’s real work. You are dealing with human beings, and young vulnerable human beings. It’s hard work and it borders on sacrificial work, because you’re often acting like a social worker, providing nutrition, and supporting children beyond just learning and stimulation. That work should be recognised, seen, compensated, and valued as work.
Even from an economic perspective — if we want a thriving economy and labour force participation — the scaffolding must exist to support that. One example I like is Colombia, where they rolled out universal access to childcare not only for early learning, but explicitly to increase women’s labour participation. They subsidised parents and also subsidised the people providing the care, recognising its value.
Q8. Building Evidence That Matters
You've worked at the intersection of research and advocacy in education and ECD. What makes evidence "policy-relevant" versus just academically rigorous? How has SmartStart navigated the tension between generating evidence and maintaining momentum on implementation?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 That is a really great question, and I think it’s one that social movements grapple with a lot.
For advocacy, policy change and legislative change, you want your research supported by theoretical evidence — like international examples and secondary desktop research. But that doesn’t do anything until you can tell the public, society and policymakers: this is what’s happening in real life.
We may know the statistics — like unemployment, poverty and inequality — but if you make those numbers real and visible, it becomes something different. If it’s just “34% unemployment,” it can feel abstract. But tie it to a story and you remember: these are human beings.
For me, being able to marry those two things — theoretical/statistical evidence and lived experience — is one of the strongest ways to inspire, evoke emotion, and create urgency. It’s one of the ways policymakers respond.
The other side of the coin is academic rigour. That kind of research is valued in academic spaces, but it can feel exclusionary and inaccessible. It can also be unrelatable, especially with highly technical approaches like randomised control trials. But it can still be helpful scaffolding for advocacy-driven research.
In my view, SmartStart leans more into advocacy evidence: research grounded in what’s real and what’s happening on the ground. It is valid research. I’m also curious what John from research and evaluation would say, because that department is newer and may want to strengthen how research is extrapolated and perhaps lean into more academic rigour.
Thabisile Zuma: If I may summarise, it sounds like there’s a place for both. While maintaining academic rigour, it’s important to lift up lived experience and qualitative stories — there are people behind the numbers.
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 You are absolutely capturing it correctly. I think a broad slate of people respond more to that kind of work because it feels personal.
For example, you might read about overcrowded classrooms and it feels distant. But when you hear about the impact on teachers — marking late at night because of the load — then it feels proximate and real.
Q9. ECD as a Constitutional Right
You've advocated for socio-economic rights in education and social protection. As South Africa moves toward universal access to two years of early learning, what does it mean for platforms like SmartStart to operate in a "right to ECD" paradigm not just a "service delivery" one?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 Beautiful question. Tough question. I’m doing some research on that, so my answer is still forming.
I’ll speak about it through Grade R. I think Grade R becoming compulsory (and possibly Grade RR in future) is an incredibly positive development. It shows that policymakers, politicians and hopefully society see how fundamental early years are for children’s success throughout the continuum.
It’s not just about school readiness — it’s about children being confident and ready for the transition into a new space with peers, with literacy and numeracy and learning expectations.
The question is what it looks like in practice. If it’s a marrying of Grade R within the public schooling system with existing early learning programmes and providers — working together — then it could be workable.
But if government says this will only happen in a school setting, then I question how. We already struggle with overcrowded classrooms, teacher shortages, and inadequate infrastructure. So the principle is beautiful, but the realisation is where the complexity lies. We need to work out what implementation will actually look like.
SECTION 4: Looking Ahead (Light, Bounded)
Closing question (Lesson for other platforms)
Thabisile Zuma: If you had to name one lesson from SmartStart’s journey that other social impact platforms should pay attention to, what would it be?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 I want to give both a SmartStart answer and my own perspective.
From a SmartStart perspective, one lesson colleagues often share is: if a model only works under perfect conditions, it won’t work at scale. That links to the realities of context, variables and complexity.
From my perspective: scale must be anchored in care for people. Scale without care for the people doing the work is unsustainable. That complexity is not an easy road. And it takes time.
Closing question (Trust in partnerships)
Thabisile Zuma: You’ve worked across many partnerships. What does it take to build trust between community-led platforms, government systems, and funders — especially when interests don’t perfectly align?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 I’ll speak from my perspective working with other organisations, because that’s where I sit in advocacy more than funders.
I think humility is key — you’re not the holder of all the answers. You come with humility, tenderness and care.
When interests don’t perfectly align, you leverage the interests that do align. But you also hold the line against co-option, without compromising what you value.
It takes iteration to work through the parts that don’t align. Some things may never align perfectly or even be resolved.
Sometimes you also ask: is this the hill I’m willing to die on? Some things you can let go of, but others you cannot. It’s navigating relationships — compromise, but with clear values.
Q12. Evidence vs Implementation Tension
Thabisile Zuma: Many platforms struggle to balance the demand for rigorous evidence with the messiness of real-world implementation. How has SmartStart navigated this tension?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 I need to think about that one properly. It’s a hard question. I would prefer to reflect and respond later.
Thabisile Zuma: Noted — I’ll email this question for a considered response. I’m also noting we should follow up on Question 5.
Final question: Franchise model limits
Thabisile Zuma: The franchise model has been central to SmartStart success, but no model is perfect. Where have you seen the franchise approach hit its limits or create unintended challenges?
Response (Hopolang Selebalo):
 I think being a social franchise makes things trickier. It’s not like a commercial franchise like McDonald’s — not something you can copy and paste.
In social contexts you deal with real life variables and changes, and you need flexibility — but you also need fidelity. What remains true? What must remain consistent to maintain quality?
There is tension between letting things play out differently in different settings, and wanting to hold things close for the purposes of fidelity. If we say we deliver a quality programme, then it must be quality — but something may need to be tweaked in a specific context.
It’s hard because it’s not a commodity. It’s not a product in the commercial sense. You’re dealing with human beings, context, changing political landscapes — the world shifts and you have to shift with it. But you also have to decide what you’re willing to change.
Centres don’t look the same. I might have limited space; someone else has more. There might be a child with special needs. There might be a parent dealing with difficult circumstances. So you can’t expect identical delivery in the way you’d produce a Big Mac in every store.
Closing / Wrap-up
Thabisile Zuma: Hopolang, you’ve shared so clearly, articulately and generously. Thank you so much. We’re about eight minutes ahead of time. If you have any questions for me, I’ll gladly answer them. I will email the questions that need further reflection to Thabo to pass on to you, and you can respond once you’ve considered them. Thank you also, Thabo, for listening into our interview.
Hopolang Selebalo: Thank you for your generosity and kindness in how you asked the questions — very tender, even the hard ones. It’s difficult because there are many possible answers. My question is: who else have you interviewed, and what is the overall substance of the 10-year report? These questions feel different from typical annual reporting — they feel retrospective and future-looking, and more high-level.
Thabisile Zuma: We’ve had the privilege of speaking with parents, SmartStarters and franchisors. My colleagues interviewed the CEO and other internal stakeholders. From my perspective, it’s been a learning journey. Parents feel they are sending children to centres with quality, and they observe changes, especially those who have moved between ECD centres. SmartStarters have a sense of pride — they are empowered, independent and running centres, doing meaningful work. Many wish they had received the same quality early learning. The franchisor perspective has been interesting across provinces — Natal versus Free State versus Northern Cape versus Western Cape — and the contextual realities are very different.
We’re finalising interviews this week. The report will tie everything together and will be reflective — celebrating what has been achieved over the decade and looking forward to what SmartStart should become going forward.
Hopolang Selebalo: That answers my question. Thank you so much — and thank you for giving me my four minutes back.
Thabisile Zuma: Thank you so much.
Hopolang Selebalo: Thanks very much.

2:27 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Hi, good morning, Kuban.

2:29 - Unidentified Speaker
Hi, how are you?

2:31 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm good, thanks. Let me also set up my camera so that you can see me. My name is Vuledzani, and we are writing the 10-Year Smart Start Report. So we would really appreciate your insight. It helps us paint like a clearer picture about smart start. Yeah, and I wanted to just let you know that I'm recording and I have a note taker for transcription purposes and I'm going to record the meeting. So I just wanted to let you know before we start.

3:18 - Kuban Pillay
No worries.

3:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Just give me a second. I just want to double check if other people are going to be joining. I think we can go ahead. If they are going to join in, I think they will just log in. Okay, so I have about 18 questions and I know that we can go into like a lot of detail but can you please just try and be very specific and be concise because we don't have the luxury of time and I think there's a lot to get into. Okay, so the first question focuses or the section focuses on the financial model fundamentals. Can you walk me through Smartstart's financial model at a high level? Where does money come from Where does it go? And how has it evolved over 10 years?

4:32 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, cool, thanks. So I mean, I've been at Smartstart for about two, a half years now. So not there from the beginning of time. So some of what I guess I'll share might be my own impressions of things, but not necessarily. I wasn't there for all of it. But yeah, the idea of Smartstart as it was sort of envisaged before Smartstart was even formulated is pretty much, I would say, what has carried through in a lot of ways right through to today. So we, you know, as a social enterprise, trying to plug the gap for new access for ECT in the most hard to reach places, is at its heart is what we're still doing. And the way in which it was sort of pictured originally as a social franchise model, It's pretty much what the financial model and operational model was based on. So we still very much work in a franchise approach, I want to say, where franchisors and partners are contracted to be more proximate to where the problems are so that they can identify people that can be trained. And set up their own micro enterprise, which is essentially a franchisee or a smart starter. So yeah, it's all the steps of the value chain is what has been incorporated into the financial modeling of how we support the program. And from initiation, we had three founding organizations. So DigiMari Trust, the Hallard Foundation Trust, and Alma Foundation. As sort of the core investors that really kickstarted Smartstart. We've stuck to that approach of finding investors of similar mind. So throughout the 10 years, we've looked for other similar types of organizations that are interested in being investors in solving for the problem, rather than the more traditional sort of service delivery funders that would and very specific things in order to get specific outcomes. And that really has helped, I think, Smartstart over to 10 become more dynamic in how we experiment, how we figure out specific things that needs to be unlocked in order to reach the places that we need to go to. So that really did, like that trust and that kind of flexibility of that type of, I want to call it unrestricted funding has really helped Smartstart grow to the point of where we are at, I think, after 10 years. And the way that works is, you know, it's contracts that span from one year to sort of three years to four years. It really depends on the different funding sources. And we report largely at an organizational level and an impact level, you know, what we're doing or what we plan to do and then what we've done against that plan rather than specifically So there's, you know, part of money that's put up annually transferred to us. And if we're meeting what we say we do on an annual basis, the investors are happy and we know we progress well. So yeah, I mean, from the income side, I think that's what we've done. We've had pockets of more restricted funding over the 10 years. So things like the jobs fund and some very specific government funding and some other funding that have come on that have tried to also be prescriptive in that way. And it's been challenging to balance the two, I think, over the years. But I think that's where the inflection point is now for Smart Start. So as we're looking to scale, we're looking for a scalable solution for the country, which means that you're going to have a mix of different types of funders. You're not going to get just your sort of foundation investors that are willing to work on a trust fund. We need to unlock government funding sources, we need to unlock some very restricted parts in order to make it accessible for new access to be more accessible, I think, in the next 10 years. So we're at that point of trying to figure out how to function in a bit of a different way for Smart Start, but also just for the ecosystem. I don't know if I answered all your questions that you asked.

9:21 - vuledzani Tshivhase
gone past some of you've answered some of the questions that are still to come but that's good um okay um uh what does it cost smart start to serve one child for one year and how does that compare to government ecd centers or private schools or private preschools rather yeah so now you're asking questions that are uh that are beyond well things that we currently believe I don't know the answers to all of those.

9:53 - Kuban Pillay
The current cost per child is, it's 1,400, let's round it to 1,400 all inclusive for the Smart Start model. So 1,400 per child per year. So what that covers is the training elements, So that's what we call the platform costs. So that's all the training and the technical support that's needed for an ERP or a smart starter. It covers the curriculum, the play kits, the light touch infrastructure support that we provide to smart starters in order to set up. It covers the stipend of a smart starter, and it covers the hub costs for Smartstart. So that's basically all of the leadership and the management and coordination activities from the hub side that work with partners. And then it covers the franchisor costs for them to support the franchisees that fall under the umbrella. And it covers, let's say, the majority of the costs cover the coaching time. So that's coaches that are employed by franchisors or by our branches that basically go out and support smart starters to make sure that you know they're operating, to make sure that they're still there, and to make sure the quality standards are met. So that's those are the things that are included. That doesn't include nutrition or it doesn't include any of the costs that a smart starter incurs themselves. So that doesn't include you know, like I said, the institution, the operating costs and salaries that they pay for people that they might employ because that forms part of like the micro enterprise part of what they do.

11:56 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And has cost per child decreased as you've scaled in reference to maybe economies of scale or increased due to complexity costs?

12:08 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, so I mean, over the years, it's fluctuated a little bit. I think, you know, we had COVID in the middle of this kind of 10-year period, which obviously just, you know, threw anomalies all over the place. So it has decreased, I'd say, from the initial stages. And we are projecting that it will decrease as we scale up to 2031. Yeah, so I don't want to quote you the figures because it's all very, it's all very, yeah, work in progress at the moment. But yeah, we do expect it to decrease significantly as we go to scale.

12:52 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, the next section focuses on operational sustainability. Smart starters are the backbone of delivery. Why do they add and is it sustainable livelihood? How has practitioner compensation evolved?

13:10 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, so again, this is not an answer we have on hand at the moment. It's part of our investment strategy work that we're doing currently. The recent survey that was done on practitioner economics Yeah, it showed us that there's very little parent fees that's being received. So in the first few years, practitioners are very reliant on the stipend that we give them, which is 550 month, or 24 months. So they use that to pay for the food, primarily for the children. I think it helps that we give them things like the and the play kits and things like that, so that they don't have to invest in those things. But the sustainability part is the question we're trying to answer at the moment, together with government and together with the ecosystem. What we're trying to unlock are a few avenues. So yeah, let me just finish the thought. They're very reliant on the stipend in the first few years. And we're seeing that if we get practitioners that are on subsidy, takes maybe two, two and a half years at best for them to actually, from the date when they establish themselves to then when they get onto being eligible to earn a subsidy. And then once they start receiving the per child per day subsidy from government, we're seeing that the cost that they report to us sort of really skyrocket. So then they start reporting to us what they pay for nutrition and what they pay for for rent. I mean, some of it is just really estimates. Some of them won't report fully. So the data that we have on practitioner spend is quite varied, I want to say. So what we get from people who are on stipends differs quite differently to what we get from people who are on subsidy. And it's only a small, like a relatively small portion of people that actually do also report on So the information we have is a little bit, is a little bit not complete, I would say. And we have to be very cautious about just like drawing too many inferences from what we see from there, because it's not, it's not a complete like representative sample. But I think those trends that we see are in line with kind of what we've expected to see and what we've heard anecdotally, I think, through when you do site visits or when you engage with franchises or or different partners, the sustainability of practitioners is really down to unlocking an earlier income for them in the earlier stages of setup. So once they're established, if we are able to get them a larger subsidy or a portion of the subsidy once they've registered, so in the registration framework currently there's bronze, and bronze basically that you own the system and then there's silver where you then now get someone to come inspect your site and they've signed you off and then now you're fully functional in the eyes of government and then you get then eligible to receive the subsidy once you're silver. So if we can try and get a subsidy at bronze stage, like a partial subsidy at bronze stage, we will then see practitioners be able to spend more on their business activities, which is food, rent, assistance, any people that need to help them. We'll see them be able to invest in infrastructure that helps them actually get to silver registration status. And then we'll also see them be able to stay on the program, then incentivize to actually stay. So we then would expect our retention rates to increase quite a lot. And all of that ultimately ends up affecting our unit. Economics, because then, you know, we don't have to replace as much, we don't have to pay for those trainers, we don't have to pay for those. But those, yeah, I guess those those early stages of set up to play kids, etc. So the unlock here is to try and get a systemic earlier livelihood support to practitioners, which currently, in a smart start model is quite difficult, because it's the that 515 and is their primary income.

17:45 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And I guess we can all kind of understand that it might not be, it might not be, maybe more or less a supplementary income rather than an income that they can live on.

18:06 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, the stipend you're talking about? Is yes yeah yeah I mean that's what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be a supplementary income so that like in theory they're supposed to be getting parents fees that cover their costs so and it does vary I mean when you go to site visits you can see uh there's some sites that are that really function very well they get their parents fees they they um they're able to like pay their assistants they're able to cover their costs uh and they function well as a business but then you get some that really struggle and they have to dip into their own household income. So the household buys rice and maize meal or whatever it is, and they use that to feed the children on a daily basis. And then whatever income they're able to get becomes something that supports, that becomes supplemental to their household income, I want to say. So we do see varied the various types of practitioners. But if we can systemize it so that there's a subsidy early enough, then that's the way we normalize that and make it accessible and consistent for all practitioners, regardless of whether you're business-minded or whether you're more child-minded.

19:28 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, thank you for that. The franchise model is central to Smart Start. From a CFO perspective, does the franchise model work financially for the partners? Are they sustainable entities or dependent on smart start support?

19:46 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, no. So the model is intentionally light, I think, in that respect. I mean, don't quote me on that comment, but we support So let's say the funding that we give to partners is meant to be, again, supplemental to the organizational funding. So we're wanting partners that are invested in solving the problem for new access in the most hard to reach places for early childhood services. And we've created a situation where there can't be financially dependent on us. So I think what we see is partners and particularly like the CEO time of partners will be not necessarily funded through our work but you know through the organizational institutional funding. It creates a bit of stress I think for partners because you know they've obviously got to balance their own books and make sure they have enough income to do what they need to do. So we do have a little bit of with our franchisors on that. But ultimately I think we're wanting to see like a little bit of agency from their side in terms of like going and sourcing their own funding to support the HCD agenda and to support their activities because that kind of agency will unlock the more localized contextual solutions to their problems and it will unlock potential funding that the longer term can flow to them but potentially other franchisees or other partners in a more localized setting. And potentially then also look at funding sources and, yeah, I guess areas where they could support ERPs a little bit better also. So I think your question was does the Smartstart’s model sustain the franchisees I would say we contribute what we think is reasonable for partners to manage the project, but we do want to see agency from the partners in funding the ECD agenda.

22:10 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. You came from TB HIV care, where you manage large operations. How would you rate Smart Start's operational efficiency? Where is the organization lean and where is it inefficient?

22:33 - Kuban Pillay
So I joined at a bit of a difficult time for Smart Start, like a bit of a change period. But also, yeah, there was a lot of stakeholder investment, the confidence, let's say, that needed to be kind of really built up and strengthened, which underpins that is like a lot of the operational processes and controls and things like that. So I think we've gone a long way to build that confidence to the point of now where I think we're getting larger injections of investment and all the investors are willing to put more money to the table, which is all positive, you know, for or smart start. I think operationally there are some areas that have to be worked on on our value chain. We've got to unlock some of the things that creates backlogs. So for example, smart spacing at the moment we find takes a little bit too long. Smart spacing is when a coach goes out and basically signs you know, functioning and functioning at the right quality standard. And, you know, that then makes them eligible for stipend. And then once they're eligible for stipend, we then onboard them and they start receiving a stipend. So there's a bit of a gap in terms of like when they are trained in startup training to when they actually then become eligible and receive a stipend. And that those operational gaps are things, you know, in our current model have to be Because if we can shorten that gap, I think we decrease retention rate, I mean increase retention rate, sorry. And we'll see a better investment or use of our investment. Because at the moment, if we're losing 25% people or more than that in some cases, the money we're spending on sending a trainer there, spending on giving them a play kit, the money that we spend on various things. At different stages, we lose the value that we put in effort-wise and money-wise, let alone the children that potentially get lost in the system and don't get that access. So I think if we can work out specific areas within the value chain that can decrease the time periods and decrease the backlogs, I think we'll be able to have a very, very clear operational model on paper versus in practice what we see coming together. And then I will say the other thing is the levels of accountability at the franchise or level and the branch level is an area we need to just see a little bit more responsibility and agency So we've fallen, I think, a little bit into the trap of holding things at the hub level a little bit too closely and not necessarily allowing the agency at a partner level or a branch level for them to problem solve and for them to be accountable for solving their own problems. So yeah, I think that's, in the next phase needs to be a push, which was the original intention of the franchise model, but I think just practicalities have sometimes shifted us to holdings maybe a little bit more too much at the hub level than we originally planned.

26:18 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I want to be more specific. So admin overhead as percentage of budget is much, partly in the bloated.

26:31 - Kuban Pillay
It depends on your perspective. I recently had this conversation with the funder and I need to pull up the documents to just find the exact percentages. But we essentially, our hub costs are kind of made up of different things, right? So there's admin and over overheads in the pure sense. So that's what I would group there is like, you know, your executive leadership time, your rent of your head office, those types of things, right, like your real kind of overhead cost. Then our hub, I want to say, is made up of like ecosystem work. So there's a lot of, not a lot, there's some investment that we make in staff and yeah, I guess workshops and things like that, that are aimed at unlocking the ecosystem opportunity. So working closely with government, working closely with other partners in the system and us having the human capital to be able to like be present, have a seat at the table, have an opinion and contribute towards like the country solutions. That's like kind of the ecosystem work that we're doing. And we specifically bring the lens of like a platform operating a new access So it's a voice that often is not heard and sometimes invisible. So the investments in the ecosystem side sit at the hub level, but it's, I wouldn't call it admin operations, I'd call it something else. Then we've got our platform support. So that's like our program operations, our curriculum design and development, and like continuous quality improvement aspects, our tech side of things. So all of those are really essential to be able to making things work and making things kind of tick. So without that, we wouldn't be able to have a national distribution network for play kits or be able to negotiate those types of prices. We won't be able to negotiate bulk printing of our materials that go into the packs for practitioners to use. We wouldn't be able to have a very, very good centralized curriculum and consistently applied curriculum, I think. So those are the kind of elements to it. Let me just see if I can find those percentages quickly for you. I did do kind of Yeah, here we go. So tune. I'll start that one. Just one second. Yeah, so currently, year budget, our total hub and ecosystem investment is about 28% our total budget. Implementation and platform, so grouping those together is about 58%, and stipends constitutes about 14%. So the hub and ecosystems is is 28 percent. And I think if I break that down further, our admin and sort of like non-ecosystem level work is around about 11 or 12 percent, I think, looking at this, which I don't think that is bloated if we compartmentalize it into into those parts. But like I was saying earlier, I think there is the opportunity to shift some of the things that sit at the hub level to a more regional level. So like maybe some of those coordination activities that now sit at the hub level may shift down a little bit. Yeah, so I mean, like on the contractual sense, we would then contract partners or regional hub to do some of those work. So it's just a shifting of the resources, I want to say, a different level. But, you know, we may find some less efficient efficiencies coming out of that because, you know, they may then use more localized partners. It might be a little bit more expensive to produce play kits or to produce the printing. But that is a strategic direction.

31:55 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And maybe it also touches on the next question. What automation or process improvements have had the biggest impact?

32:08 - Kuban Pillay
Over the 10 years? Yeah, I mean, I think that's a tough one to say because there's a few things that have had very impact results, I think. I wanted to say Funda app, but I I don't think I can, because I don't think it's had the impact that we wanted it to have. But one of the big things that we have done over the 10 was create one app, which is an application for practitioners to use so that they can manage their daily programs, manage their class schedules, et cetera. And then we have the data. But we have hit into a few problems on uptake, on kind of offline, online sort of functionality, yeah, reliability of the data, what's being input versus what we see on the reporting. So, yeah, I would say it hasn't quite had the impact as yet, but the learnings that we're going through with all of that is still something that will feed into next iteration of what would be a technology platform for the country, I think. So in the next phase, I think we're looking at like an integrated technology solution that brings together multiple systems potentially and brings it to one database and data source so that the country as a whole is seeing new ELPs and quantiles one and two, as well as existing ELPs and quantiles four, five, whatever, all in one place so that there's collective decision making and things like that. So that whole process of developing for NAHAP really put us, I would say, quite on the map in terms of the use of technology for early learning. Within Smartstart, I think we've, I mean, I can speak on the finance side from when I started to say, we really have nailed down our processes internally in terms of a strong control environment. Our audits work pretty smoothly from now. Like I was saying earlier, the stakeholder investment or confidence, let's say, has increased quite a lot, which I think is having a direct impact on on the willingness to fund more. So I think from that perspective, it's like really just making sure your foundations are very solid and there's this trust and this confidence in those foundations. I think the biggest impact is that it can unlock bigger pots of money that goes into helping us shift towards scaling our solution. We've used the various tools like Power BI, we've used different types of things like that that have just helped automate and reduce times that things take to provide real-time views. All of our budget holders have real-time views of their budgets and expenses so they can make decisions quicker, there's not a delay in relying on someone from finance given that type of information. So it's like little things like that, that sounds little, but I think is big in like a budget holder's life. And in our context can be the difference between whether you do a set of startup training, like in March versus doing it in November. So yeah, it's like a collection of little improvements, I think that has built greater stakeholder confidence.

36:17 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you. Thank you for that. I think we need to, also be very mindful of time when you respond, we don't have much of it. So the next section focuses on financial risks and vulnerabilities. Looking at the funder base, how concentrated is smart start revenue? If your top three funders pulled out, what happens? And I would like for you, as you're reflecting on that question, touch on what percentage of revenue comes from the top five funders. You could also include these multi-year, you could also respond with, are these multi-year commitments or annual grants? Has Smart Start lost a major funder? How did it navigate that? So you could just try and include, yeah.

37:12 - Kuban Pillay
If you want shorter answers, you need to ask shorter questions. Less complicated ones.

37:21 - vuledzani Tshivhase
We want details.

37:28 - Kuban Pillay
Our top three funders, I mean, essentially our core funders, that's Yellowwoods, Alma, DGMT, If our top three funders pulled away, it would mean the dissolution of Smartstart because they are founding members. So I don't think that will happen. And I want to say what has been good is that the support has been consistent. And in this phase, in this year, we've negotiated new contracts with them, and there's been significantly increased investment. As in like three, four times more than what they used to put in before. So that's why now they're definitely like at the top end of our investors. If they were to pull out, I would say, you know, the work that Smartstart is doing, yeah, I say tongue in cheek that we would dissolve, but we wouldn't dissolve because the work will still continue and need to continue because we are the ones that are really pulling, sort of the biggest weight in terms of new access. And I think we would have to look at different types of philanthropy funding. So we have started building relationships with things, not building relationships, but we've put in like applications over the years with things like MacArthur and Audacious, et cetera. So yeah, I think it would just be really trying to convert some of those like new pipelines into more solid contracts and there would be greater urgency with that. Yeah, and I would say we would have to, so it's not, I don't have the percentages on hand. I would have to go and work all of that out. But like, I think the point you're getting to with that question is like, is there one funder that funds you like 80% of your funding? It's not the case. It's like, they're pretty much like sort of between 10% to 15%, I think. Each of those. So we have quite a diverse sort of like equalized allocation of funding, I would say. So if one, two, three of them have to go, I don't see that as being like detrimental to Smart Start. We'll be able to still continue. We may have to continue at a smaller scale, at a smaller size organization, but the pipeline of existing funders outside of our core funders, I think is strong enough for us to be to still operate and also still to contribute towards the ecosystem's efforts, I think, to plug the gap. I don't know if I answered all the questions that you asked, but I think that was a good question.

40:18 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Are these multi-year commitments or annual grants? Yeah, multi-year. Oh, okay. And has Smart Start lost a major funder and how did you navigate that?

40:31 - Kuban Pillay
I am not aware of us losing a major funder since I started so I can't really yeah I can't really comment on that one. We've just been growing an existing batch. I mean I would say like our one of our major funders has come to an end, like a natural end, like we always expected that to happen. So they're also probably like an 8% of the total contribution or 6%. But anyway, the point is we've replaced them. So we've replaced them with a new pipeline and we have a strong pipeline for that funder to be replaced specifically for the next few years. So the methodology, I guess, is that we try to understand people want to exit and some of them have limitations on how long they can fund us for. And if that's the case, we will eventually try and build that pipeline.

41:32 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what's Smartstart's cash position? Industry standard is three to six months reserves. Where is Smartstart? Has Smartstart had the delay payment or cut programs due to cash flow? And how do you manage lumpy funding versus consistent program costs?

41:56 - Kuban Pillay
Just repeat that last question. What do you mean?

42:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And how do you manage lumpy donor funding, like maybe a lump sum, versus consistent program costs?

42:10 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, I'm not sure I understand that last one. So our cash pipeline is about seven to eight months, I would say. So we're pretty strong with having enough cash and reserves to be able to fund operations if we hit delays in receipts. And yeah, we do have some instances where receipts are maybe two months outside of what we're expecting. But since I've been at Smart Start, we've not had a problem with it affecting operations. So we never had to shut anything down because of that. And yeah, so the way we manage our cash flow is we have a schedule, we expect our receipts, you know, we compare that to our forecasted sort of costs for the month, and yeah, we make sure that there's cash to fund that. So it means we have to balance some of the reserves that we may use now and then and replenish once we get it, but that's not really beneficial. A challenge for us, luckily.

43:19 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And looking ahead, from a CFO risk perspective, what are the top three financial vulnerabilities or risks must start faces over the next five years?

43:34 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, so the next five years, I think is, is not, is not changing our prevention sufficiently enough. And what I mean by that is we have to exponentially increase the ability to reach more children without increasing our costs. So practically that means practitioners need to have higher child ratios. Practically we need to bring in existing ELPs without necessarily need to invest in them that show us that they're reaching new children. We need to make sure that is, yeah, so essentially like whatever levers need to be pulled. So if it's a technology lever to say, well, if we introduce this bit of technology, then our code number of coaches doesn't need to be the same number of coaches forward and we can actually do with a lot less. So technology as a lever, and I want to say the risk is not using technology as a lever because our model largely assumes that technology will be a lever. I would say not making key lever assumptions, revisions to assumptions in our model, so like the coach ratio. And I would say that the other risk is not getting income to practitioners early enough. So yeah, if we're not able to get them sustainable livelihood early enough, then we would be risking the sort of sustainable model as a whole for reaching the most hard to reach children.

45:29 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And the next section focuses on the tenure financial evolution. Over 10 years, where the key financial inflections, points, moments, where Smart Start's financial trajectory changed significantly?

45:50 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, again, I can't speak to when I wasn't at Smart Start, but like I was saying earlier, when I joined in in 2023, was a very difficult time from the financial side of things. We needed to rebuild a lot of confidence from funders. There was a very big change happening in the leadership side of Smartstart. So we had to very quickly put things in place, which we did do, and I think we have done well to build that stakeholder confidence. Yeah, and I would say that we, over the years, have learned what the key levers are that need to be pulled. So from the financial modeling side and operationally, just over the years, and I'll say particularly over the last two years, where we've built a financial model that links with our projections work, and the key assumptions from the projections side of like how many children and how many practitioners do we need. It links directly to our financial model so that we can look at, you know, if we make the set of assumptions on projections, what's the financial implications like at a total level that has helped really like define our pipeline building from a fundraising perspective. But it's also helped look at the unit economics and say, is that something that's like in the ballpark of what we're looking at or not? What else needs to be added. So it's become the bones of like what would be an investment strategy that would need to be worked on together with government going forward. But I would say those are sort of some big wins of like bringing some good linkage between various aspects of our organization, but really forms the foundation of like into the future what's needed from the government side to help plug this gap.

47:55 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And looking back financially, what assumptions or decisions from the LES turned out to be wrong and what did Smart Start have to unlearn?

48:14 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, I would say maybe the agency of partners and branches from the early days. So the way the model is devised in that a franchise all would be willing to be responsible and actually take ownership of their targets and numbers and solving for the problems within their geographies. I think the assumption that that would happen was probably not entirely correct, which I think led to the hub taking on some of those you know, things that like weren't necessarily covered by them. So, yeah, I think what that has done is that sort of, I would say like the last three, four years, it's created a methodology of how Smartstart works. And that I think needs to be unlearned in a lot of ways, because we have to go back to the original model and original intention and original design, and start thinking about how to enable our partners and branches to do more of that more proximate problem solving that we initially thought they would do. So it's kind of going back to basics a little bit, I think, and unlearning some of the firefighting sort of like things that have become institutionalized a little bit at the hub side.

49:38 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. And our next section focuses on financial sustainability pathway. Is there a realistic pathway for Smart Start to become less donor dependent? What would it take? And I would like for you to also reflect on could government subsidy ever cover full costs? Is there end revenue, potential, training, licensing and consulting? And maybe should Smart Start aim for independence, or is mixed funding optimum? And what's the realistic timeline for all those things?

50:19 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, again, you're asking questions that we would love the answers to. My opinion is that I think the kind of admin leadership portion of the hub will always be to be funded. I can't see that necessarily being funded by government or, yeah, systemic. I can see that particularly in the next few years, up to would 2031, probably need that still in place. And the challenge that we're trying to get to now is figuring out exactly who should be payers at scale. So who should be paying for what elements by when, So part of our investment strategy is going to come to exactly that answer. And the platform is an area where we want to make visible so that government does pay for that in some way. And, you know, as well as obviously the implementation costs. So like what happens at a ground level, the coaching costs, all of those things are definitely elements that government should be paying for. So we want to try and make that case so that by 2030 slash 2031, I think we want to be able to see government as a payer at scale at that point. I mean, the arbitrary sort of splits that we've always talked about is a 70-30 split. So at least 70% of the total cost should be funded by government. And definitely the practitioner costs should be funded through the subsidy. So at the moment, I think we suspect that the subsidy is not sufficient to cover everything that needs to be covered, that a practitioner may actually reasonably incur from their cost side. But that's also another question that we may answer through the investment strategy and then therefore feed into the advocacy work that needs to go into trying to change that.

52:29 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I also feel like you've answered my next question, but if there's anything to add to it, please do. Smart Start aims for one million children by 2030. What does that mean financially? What's the capital requirement and where will it come from

52:46 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, like I said, we're still really busy with the projection work, the modeling that needs to go into where we'll end up. At the moment, it doesn't look by 2030, will be a million children. I mean, realistically, I think it will be less than that. We'll probably have to aim for a million maybe by 2031 or a bit later than that. But yeah, I think overall, just give me one second. Sorry, I just Hi, sorry about that. Yeah, so your question was by 2030 to reach a million, what would be the investment? So again, like, I can't give you like a firm answer on that, because we're still really busy with, with actually what we're projecting. So are we going to reach a million or are we going to reach 700,000? Or do we plan to reach 600,000? But yeah, we like to say whatever the modeling is, it'll get it needs to be a scalable reach at that point with a much reduced unit cost per child.

54:28 - vuledzani Tshivhase
You've worked in health, finance, and now ECD. How is financial leadership different in a social impact platform versus corporate or health sectors?

54:42 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, so I worked in a very much a service health organization where, yeah, I want to say like a lot of the, like health as a sector I think is a lot more prioritized by government and much more established, let's say, over the years. So it's, I want to say like, because of that establishment, there's a lot of interest, investment, well-established practices, and people know what they need to do, I have to say. Whereas coming into the ECD space, I think it reminds me of when I was working in child and youth care work, where a lot of advocacy still needs to be done. A lot of institutionalization needs to be done. A lot of political will needs to be won, and budgets needs to be allocated. And then with that comes the processes. So I would like just the phase of development of the sectors is at a point of where it's maybe a little bit more complex because people are still figuring out those elements. So yeah, it's been interesting and challenging from that perspective compared to the health side. And I see a lot more investment in the advocacy into the kind of systems development into those areas, whereas in health it was very much you need to reach people, you need to test them, you need to cure them, it's all about service delivery. So yeah, that's the major difference that I've experienced personally.

56:30 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And in reference to technology and automation, how has technology transformed Smart Smartstart operational efficiency?

56:38 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah I think I answered that one a little bit earlier.

56:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay and if there's one financial truth about scaling early learning that you want policymakers, funders or other platforms to understand something the sector often misunderstands or underestimates, what would it be?

57:01 - Kuban Pillay
Let's look Yeah, I think it's what it actually takes to set up and support a new practitioner in Quantiles 1 and 2. I don't think that there's enough consistent visibility or appreciation for that, and I think particularly the costs of practitioners supporting the children in their centres. I think there's an under-appreciation and an under-resourcing so that the legislation doesn't enable practitioners in our settings to actually fully support children and So yeah, I mean, that's a complicated process because there's like the legislation requirements and informal ELPs and home-based ELPs viewed in the right way. But there's a lot of progress on that. But like I was saying earlier, I think getting livelihood income to practitioners in our quantiles earlier is the key. And if we can make visible those elements maybe will move in that direction.

58:28 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, so we have just three more questions. Grant was overseeing sense-making and learning. From your operational vantage point, how does Microsoft capture and use data to inform decisions while systems are in place?

58:47 - Kuban Pillay
Yeah, so I think we have a lot of information at Smartstart. Our data systems are comprehensive in the sense of quite well disaggregated programmatic data, quite well, yeah, I think relatively real-time capturing that happens. So not backlogs in terms of capturing, and I think on the financial side, we have similarly good enough disaggregated data. We make the use of Power BI quite a lot and it's quite well established within the organization. I think it's really about creating the right information for the right people at the right time, and just making sure that visibility is consistent and that visibility is accounted for by the right people also. I think information can be used. If we establish those practices, then we'll quite quickly be able to see whether the information is correct or not, how good quality is it, how bad is it. But we have all the building blocks to be able to have quite well and sophisticated data reporter.

1:00:16 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And how do insights from the field translate into organizational changes? Can you maybe walk me through an example where data or practitioner feedback led to program adaptation?

1:00:38 - Kuban Pillay
I can't say for sure on the operational side, to be honest. I haven't seen that, except for, I will say, on the technology side. When Funda app was released, we had a concurrent system called Funda app. And Funda Chat is like a WhatsApp-based thing. And yeah, basically, people in the field were like, oh, they're struggling with Funda. They can't access. There's issues. So there was a decision then to like, you know, re-institute from the chat. So that there's like a parallel system so that if people can't get onto from the app, they can use from the chat to do their submissions and things like that. So, I mean, that's the one example that's popping to mind. That's quite a clear like cry from practitioners to say, oh, we need help here. And that was the response. So yeah, ideally, I think we still want to move to from the app eventually. Once all the issues are ironed out. That's a quick example. That's the one that pops to mind.

1:01:43 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And last question. Over 10 years, what were the two, three biggest operational or program changes must have made based on evidence or learning from I think biggest changes, um, I will say is exploring the use of technology in a broad sense.

1:02:14 - Kuban Pillay
Um, so the use of smart link and adjusting the thing like they're like micro things that happen within the field that say we need this, we need that. You add extra fields on our SmartLink application. The use of Funda app and what the development on to say, and then the release of Funda app, I think was a big, so like I would group that in terms of like just exploring the use of technology to help enable changes. In the last year, one of the big changes was introducing assistance as in as a formal acknowledgement. So in the past, we always had smart starters who would employ assistants by themselves, but we never quite formally recognized them. So in this year, we've come up with the training incorporated into the annual planning so that assistants are trained and formally recognized, I think, within the kind of model structure. And then we also repurposed community activators to be field officers. So the field officers are roles that would take on more of the coach work. So some of the admin work or admin support to franchisees, et cetera, with the hope that coach time is released so that they can plug some of the backlogs that I was referring to earlier. Yeah, so those are the things that are popping to mind on major program shifts. So the other one, I guess, is maybe regional hubs. So in the Eastern Cape, there was a good experiment around two franchisors subcontracting a more localized, smaller CBO. Organization to actually do the work of what we think a franchisor would do. So it's like a sub-franchisor sort of pilot, I want to say. So that to me is a good test of shifting some of the national level hub responsibilities onto a regional hub. And then the regional hub is able to then contract more local even more localized organizations. So that would definitely help with community entry and establishing smart start with localized leaders, et cetera, and community leaders, but also may help cut down some of the travel time that coaches might need to go at and ultimately reach the more informal and more rural settings. That we know are not being reached. So that's a good shift in that it propels us into that realm.

1:05:20 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much for your time. We've gone over the time by three minutes. But thank you so much for your time. Thank you for your insights. And yeah, this was very insightful. Thank you so much.

1:05:32 - Kuban Pillay
Hey, thank you. Thanks very much. Have a good day.

1:05:35 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you


Programme : Justine Jowell 
Smartstart 10 Year Report Interview
Tue, Feb 10, 2026

0:01 - vuledzani Tshivhase
So I think that's where most of my issues are.

0:08 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Got it, got it.

0:09 - Emmanuel luthuli
You'll be fine.

0:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Hello, good afternoon. Is it still afternoon? It is still afternoon. How are you? How are you doing today?

0:33 - Emmanuel luthuli
I'm good, thanks. And you?

0:34 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm good. Thank you for making the time. I know it's probably not.

0:41 - Justine Jowell
Thank you for the late one, because I was the only spot. Sorry for making you guys be late today. We just have a conference. So we're in three days conference. It only ended at five. So that's why. So sorry about that.

0:54 - vuledzani Tshivhase
No, not a problem. My name I am part of a team that is writing the 10-Year Report for Smart Start. So we thought that your design perspective is unique and is essential in telling the Smart Start story. So thank you again for making the time. Hi, good afternoon to all. Joining us is my colleague Lunt. He's just going to be observing. I will be recording the meeting and I have a note taker taking down our notes. I hope you're fine with me recording.

1:40 - Unidentified Speaker
Totally fine, that's all good.

1:45 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, awesome. Okay, I feel like we need to get started. I have I think 27 questions so we need to be very Very specific with the responses and very concise, just so that we can all start dinner on time. Okay, so section A focuses on origins and design foundations. Take me back to the early days, You were there when Smart Starts Model What was the problem you were trying to solve? And what were the design principles?

2:28 - Justine Jowell
So, I mean, I was at the time, me and the other colleague who were part of the team that did the initial thinking about this, we worked for the Digimatic Trust. And the at the time, the trust had an ECD portfolio, but what they were seeing were small pockets of quality ECD programming happening around the country, so small pockets of people starting to make some difference to ECD provision, but none of it at scale and often quite unaffordable and not really changing the dial that we needed to in South Africa. So we weren't getting any of this movement. Things are sort of stagnated around increased ECD. There were some market-based responses that were happening, like people just setting up ECD centres because there was a need in their community, but because our employment rates are quite high, there wasn't a massive push for that and often the quality wasn't that great. And NGOs who did support that were all doing their work in very siloed places. So everybody would have their own monitoring and evaluation system and their own marketing. And so it was not coordinated in any way. So there was, the team had said that we should, at DGMI part of the strategy was we need to be thinking about how we can figure out a scale solution for this. So some way to try to increase access and increase access to quality early learning. So not just putting people in early learning programs, but access to quality. And so for the first Year, we actually got together a group of NGOs in a sort of think tank. We met with them once a month to look at different ideas, like just open sourcing, distribution, social franchising, looking at different types of models that one could increase access. And came to the social franchise model as an idea. There's about, I think, eight NGOs involved in that, of which most were in the ECD sector. We also had someone from franchising involved, like corporate franchising. So it was like a think tank of trying to come to the idea. And through that process, the very initial idea of a program that could be quite quick to establish, so based in a home and a community. And a lot of the thinking at the time was working with a playgroup model because we thought that could be more efficient cost-wise. We could train someone and they could run two or three different playgroups, so children attending only a few days a week. That in its infancy was the original idea with Smart Start. It actually expanded out of playgroups because market demand from parents and communities was that it's quite a middle-class idea of being able to drop your child off for just a few days a week. Most people and needed a full week's programming. And so that was where the programs started to lean in. And so we still do have a small number of playgroups, mostly run with stipended programs, so government support. But that's, yeah, so government-specific expanded words-type programs. And there's still quite a lot of interesting things to explore there, but that the main model is actually a full-time home and community based micro social franchise, micro social enterprise.

5:44 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what did you know wouldn't work? And what did you insist had to be part of the model?

5:53 - Justine Jowell
So we knew that there were lots of people doing training and qualifications, but that didn't necessarily result in good quality programs. Or people who really felt competent in what they were doing. And later, pieces of child outcomes evaluation, both ours and others, have proven that to be true, that a qualification doesn't necessarily result in better outcomes for children. So we knew that our training had to both be very practical, but have a strong coaching component. So we knew that training on its own was never going to be enough. It needed to be grounded in practical support, someone who gives you feedback uh, coaches you on your practice. And I mean, it's true for most, uh, forms of education. Like if you do a teaching degree, you have to do a practical component. So we knew that that was always going to be part that coaching in field is going to be a, an important part of the model. Um, but we knew that that had to be scalable. So we knew that that coaching had to taper over time or had to be directed only to people in the most need, which is why we sort of developed, we have a PTA system, which is program quality assurance system, which helps us see, you know, who needs the most amount of support when. So green franchisees need less coaching, orange need more coaching, red need to sort of immediate urgent support. That was the other part. And then we also knew in the beginning when we started, we knew we'd have to support people financially because it takes a while to register. And in the, and at that time it was actually very difficult for programs to register. Now there's been quite a lot of movement. In the ECD space to make that more achievable, and that's been work that we've been very involved in. So you might speak to other people about that in Smart Start. But at that time, it was very hard to register as an ECD program in an informal community or a poor community. So it was very hard to get registration, and you can only qualify for government subsidies when you're registered. So even when you're registered, it's hard to apply. So both those things we knew were hard. So we knew that if we were trying to support programs in poor areas, we needed a financial match. And in the beginning, that was things like the CWP, the Community Works Program, the EPWP, Expanded Public Works Program. We knew that there had to be a stipend. But those two programs were really tricky to work with because they were so constrained and limited and required each agent in each area to know and understand. And often, the recruitment of people into that program weren't always ideal people. Of actually people that are interested in ECD. So we knew there needed to be a financial model, but that's the model that's moved over time. We better and better understand this as a social enterprise that needs what we now give as a startup stipend just for the first two years to enable the business to sort of get going. But over time, how people either access government funding or strengthen their parent fee collection, their become a stronger program. Um, what else did we know should be in there? And we obviously, we, we knew that the program itself had to be super simple to implement. So like understandable and easy, but that'd be based on evidence around what works for strong child outcomes. So our program, routine curriculum training is very based on, on a play based approach that looks at like sort of very, um, relationship-nurturing-focused attention for children. So not relying on the curriculum, which has also not been necessarily proven. The curriculum becomes a support for the pedagogy, but the lead emphasis is actually to have very strong pedagogical practices, and that we knew we'd have to develop in our network.

9:40 - vuledzani Tshivhase
A smart start is built on five pillars. Nurture, talk, play, stories, and parent partnership. Walk me through how those were chosen, why these five, what's the pedagogical logic?

9:56 - Justine Jowell
Yes, so just to say, so that's the Smart Start daily routine, not necessarily Smart Start. So I'll just be clear, it's not Smart Start built on that, it's the Smart Start daily routine. And those five things come from evidence. So we looked at global evidence. We tried to pull as much of the developing South and developing worlds in literature reviews on that. But when you look at programs that give strong child outcomes, they hold those things true. They look at lots of rich use of language, nurturing environments where people feel safe and cared for, opportunities for open-ended play, but not just play without a practitioner, play that's supported by a practitioner. And then the opportunity for story sharing, imagination, and so on, and then that's underpinned strong relationships with parents. And that's true for school too. Those parents, you know, there's a lot of research that shows that parents involved in their child's schooling through the way, through the journey of education often have stronger outcomes than those children whose parents are not at all engaged. So those parent partnerships are really important. Also because the other piece of research is that home learning environments are really important for greater success. An ECD program on its own is often not able able to make enough difference in a child's trajectory if you don't support the home environment at the same time.

11:17 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And were there other pillars considered and rejected? How have the pillars evolved in practice?

11:26 - Justine Jowell
No, I mean, I think if you're talking about pillars of the model, then there's been changes, right? So there's been moves from like the social where there's a program that's a kind of, a program that can get inserted in any site and replicated in the same way to more understanding Smart Start as a platform of tools and processes that enable early learning to scale. I think if you look at the actual program methodology, which is those five pillars, and that's why I'm trying to separate out for you, those are not Smart Starts pillars, that's the Smart Starts program pillars. That's what happens in a program. But the smart start structure itself is much broader than just the program. Smart start structure is the idea of partner franchises, coaches, a network of smart starters. And those things have changed over time. So one of those pieces might be the club and the importance of the club. But those pillars haven't substantially changed, no, because those are based on evidence around the kinds of programs that work for children to learn and develop. As we looked at results of our child outcomes evaluations, for example, is that certain parts of our curriculum might need to get strengthened based on, you know, things that, when you look at the domains of child development, maybe some domains that we're not making as great gains as others. Like, so, for example, there was a time in our first child outcomes evaluation where it was looking at, for example, we were not getting as good gains on fine motor. So, we really looked at how do we strengthen that part of our program. Practitioners have access to crayons and scissors and so on so that they can be working fine motor skills. Currently the most current evaluation is also sort of showing that there's needing to focus on gross motor development and how do we strengthen that in our program. If the pillars haven't changed, those remain the same.

13:27 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. There's a difference between designing a programme and designing a programme that can scale to 15,000 practitioners, how did you design Smartstart to be scalable from day one?

13:44 - Justine Jowell
I think what we tried to do from day one was a mix of what would give us good outcomes versus what could be done in the cheapest possible or simplest possible way. So we tried the programme to keep things very The training is light. The coaching is light. And the coaching, as I mentioned, sort of staggers and staggers off over time. So it's more intense in the first Year. When someone is in second and third Year, that scales down. We've looked to build technological support systems for the coaches and for the franchisees, like digital platforms that would enable that. I think we always try to have a lens of like, whenever we add something, being very cautious about the addition. So both from a cost perspective, but also from just whenever you add something, things get more complicated, right? So trying to say, if we add something, we're either adding it because we're not meeting that outcome and we have to, or we're adding it to save a cost or make something more efficient. And otherwise we shouldn't add. We should try to keep things quite the same and quite simple, yeah.

14:59 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what design choices prioritise scale over depth? Where did you refuse to compromise quality for scale?

15:10 - Justine Jowell
Well, I think the first one has to go back to even that assumption. I don't think scale means you have to compromise quality. So I think that was a very important principle for us. From the get-go. I think that's always been some of the misunderstanding about smart side is that one, because one's scaling, one is compromising quality. So I think that's a really important thing. I think, for example, some of the big tensions were when we looked at other organizations who provided play kits. They would look at our play kit and say, wow, that's not enough. That's like so little toys and resources for a program. You need a play kit that's triple the price or quadruple the price. What we did was saying, well, what is the minimum we could use to achieve the outcomes for children? And how do we support a practitioner, for example, to make their own choice, to access resources in other places, to actually use more of their pedagogy than the resources to do that? So resources are important for children, but we just knew at scale we can't afford to provide just everything that's needed. So how do we provide the bare minimum? And then on that, making sure we did things like very rigorous and extensive child outcomes evaluations with external partners to make sure we actually were getting the outcomes we thought we were getting. So we weren't tricking ourselves into believing that with less resources we could still achieve. I think that was a critical thing we didn't ever want to It was that we would never compromise child games for any of the changes we made. So changes might squeeze other things, you know, like in the process, like maybe retention of practitioners because they struggled to earn fees or something, but never wanting to compromise on the child games.

17:06 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And why a franchise model? What were the alternatives? You considered? What made franchising the right architecture for this work?

17:16 - Justine Jowell
So we looked at other things like branches, open distribution networks where you just, you know, you make everything available for free. And the combination was at the time there was no government quality assurance So there's this mix of like, if you're going to go to scale, you need some kind of standards and you need them in some form, otherwise you won't get quality. So that's where we, and then how do we use those principles of social franchising, which is like standards that are minimum across all in the most efficient way, understood by different role players we're implementing in local context. So we never had the social franchise model idea that nothing could be different. There was always the idea that there should be local variation adaptation, that there's a minimum package that you can replicate everywhere and not have to, I guess, reinvent the wheel everywhere you go. And that if you do that for social good, you can achieve quite a lot. And then particularly another big important part of social franchising is the power of a brand, right? So that's the same thing with corporate franchising that having something like, you know, a recognized brand like Mando's, whatever, gives power to the implementers, to the parents, to the net, to the community. So there were a couple of those reasons. It was like, yeah, the cost efficiencies are enabled by central coordination. We originally didn't go with a branch model because we didn't want to, we wanted to be able to learn from other partners as we'd done in the first Year. Other people in the field in order to create the program. We wanted partners in our network who would adapt locally, challenge the model, give input into changes that would be more efficient. And we still, the majority of our programs are partner organizations. We have now got four branches, and that emerged over time, more in the last couple of years for various reasons. But the branches are also an important place learning now because it allows us to experiment a little bit easier and test.

19:34 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Did anything scare you about franchising and what convinced you it could work?

19:45 - Justine Jowell
I think we did a lot of case study work on other social franchises in the education space which really helped. There weren't many in the ECD space, there's only one small we looked at in Columbia. But we did a lot of case study work, which helped, I think, make one feel a little bit more at ease with the choice we were making. And also, the input from the think tank of partners, and then the appetite of those partners to be the first franchisors, I think, also helped us know we're making the right decision. We also worked a lot of learning from other social franchises in South Africa, like Love Life. And so there was opportunity to learn from other positive stories. I think obviously it's a thing that has been challenging and which is potentially something to watch out for in social franchising is that when the control comes too much into the centre and it doesn't allow for enough ownership, local adaptation and movement which is why we're moving from the sort of more social franchise model to a platform model or trying to open that platform as we go forward so that it starts to be more informed by local context, ownership sits locally. Yeah, so I think that's something that we're working on as our new strategy and where we go in the future.

21:07 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And when the model first launched in Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me?

21:20 - Justine Jowell
Are you there? Yes, I'm here. I can hear you both.

21:25 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Oh, OK. Thank God.

21:28 - Justine Jowell
Just saying. Yes, I can hear you now, Thabo, and I can hear you, Bolenzani. You just froze for a minute. I don't know if it's my side or your side. No, it's probably like a lag or something.

21:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Oh, OK. First launched in 2015-2016. What broke? What design assumptions hit reality and had to change?

21:56 - Justine Jowell
So I think I've mentioned some of them already. The idea that we were going to run mostly play groups in partnership with a sort of a public works program. I think the difficulty of partnering with some of the public works programs and also the market demand around playgroups that we actually found in many of our in many of our communities there was more of demand for the full day program. The other thing was we didn't in the beginning have strong business support because we assumed we were going to partner with these public works programs so we assumed people would be getting income and what we found over time was that that was not a reality and therefore we needed to support people with the sustainability. So in the early days we didn't have a strong lens at all around business Our lens was around how to establish an early learning program. Now the lens more and more is into how do we support the sustainability of these programs? How do we help them grow into small micro enterprises or at least access government subsidy so that they can be sustainable? What else shifted? I think what's also been is our idea of the coach work of of the time getting lighter and lighter, I think some of the administrative requirements we needed for reporting to funders, keeping the program going have meant that the coach work has been quite, has changed a lot over time and become quite a, yeah, there's like real pressure on the coaches, both time-wise, but also ratios. Many of them are very high ratios. And there's a lot of thinking we need to do around how do we better enable our coaches' efficiency in field, as well as support with other kinds of support. Like some of the things we've been testing in the model over the last while is telephonic support through a call center, online support through training and an app, and also peer support through clubs. So how do we activate all those things to take pressure off the coaching network and enable the coaches to reach more people at scale.

24:09 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. And the next section focuses on program evolution. How has Smart Starts training approach changed over 10 years? What did you learn about what works for training practitioners in low resource communities?

24:34 - Justine Jowell
I'm not sure our training approaches have changed a huge amount. I think right from the beginning we knew it had to be experiential and practical and engaging and we knew it had to be paired with coaching. So I'd almost never want to describe our training approach without our coaching approach to it. Training on its own is not sufficient. To enable people to really shift. So I think what is really important about the training that we learned, what we did learn over time is the critical importance of investing in trainers who are transformative trainers, able to really engage with participants, but also trainers from the context in which people work has really also been great and important. What we did learn is like, how do we keep continuing to simplify our program. So not the risk is always that you want to add more and add more. And then sometimes it's add more handbooks, add more training. And how do we really pack this thing as simply and as neatly as possible? So that's been a big part of it. And then I think what we're learning about is what we can do remotely, like online. And I think we've got a lot more to learn about that. I don't think we just at the beginning of that baby steps, which we'd be thinking more about sort of online and remote training but what we have been learning a lot about is how peers can support each other to learn through clubs and the training in clubs.

26:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay so the next question is in reference to localization versus standardization. You need standardized quality across 15,000 practitioners but also local adaptation. How did you design for both? How does the program for localization without losing quality?

26:22 - Justine Jowell
So I think because the program quality assurance looks at pedagogical behaviors rather than curriculum itself, it doesn't require them to implement the same curriculum every day. What that enables is local adaptation at the program level. So for a smart starter who wants to incorporate stories from their environment, games and activities that fit their process, their community, that's all possible. Because a coach isn't judging someone on, did you teach these shapes? Did you run the program exactly like that? It allows adaptation in the coach. And then what's, we worked more or less successfully over time is also allowing franchisors to have some adaptation in how they run the program. So knowing that they've got key things they have to implement, but they learn and adapt about the way it works for them. And that we are also, I think that probably when we went, there was a stage where we probably were controlling that a little bit too much and now we learn about how do we open that up more for engagement, adaptability and so on.

27:48 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I've heard about the shift to visual curricula when practitioners in the Eastern Cape couldn't use English heavy materials. Tell me that story, how did design respond to that reality?

28:05 - Justine Jowell
So I'm not sure exactly which story you're referring and maybe, I don't know if you're interviewing other people from the early learning design team, but we, I mean, in the training itself, they are given a handbook, but practitioners are not. I mean, the trainers are trained to firstly train in vernacular for that area, but also to make sure that everything's practical. It doesn't require people reading a handbook in order to learn. So that's one piece. The other piece is that all our work with parents is only visual, so there's no text in the home stories, activities, and so on, because often that is a struggle for parents, particularly at literacy levels. So I'm not sure which story you're referring to there on the Eastern Cape, but maybe more context I could answer that, but I don't know that one.

28:57 - vuledzani Tshivhase
No, no, no. If that's the case, then I feel like we can move on. How has technology program design over the years? What tools have enabled scale? What hasn't worked?

29:17 - Justine Jowell
So having a central administrative system in Smartha has been really important for coordinating tracking of activities and processes across the network and across the partners. I think you've got a lot to learn about making that more usable for people and so that it better serves people. So I would say it's a combination of being a very impactful tool as well as needing work to continue making it even more impactful in how the work is delivered. For the franchisees themselves, I think WhatsApp as a platform, separate, like not owned by Smart Start, has been a powerful platform for organizing, for club work, for coach support. We had a We have a coach, I mean, a franchisee WhatsApp bot, which we've used relatively successfully, but there's lots more work and thinking through how that could be more effective. There's quite a lot of research currently around how one can use AI to generate support and engagement through the WhatsApp that we haven't yet activated. And that's something we really need to explore. But we did have a sort of data administrative and program sort of reporting things through WhatsApp that worked really well. The call center has been very powerful. For supporting our smart starters at various ports along the way. Sort of remote support, not traditionally digital, but it is very important, like technical platform. And then, last Year we launched an app that we've had some teething problems with the app itself, but so we've had some very positive stories from smart starters who are finding it very useful for marketing their program, better, easier program administration, access to resources. But because of some of the problems with like low connectivity, some of the challenges of design, it's going through a process of review and redevelopment to think how we can make that more impactful for the greater portion of our smart drivers.

31:25 - vuledzani Tshivhase
15,000 practitioners, how do you maintain quality? What's the design logic behind Smart Starts quality systems?

31:36 - Justine Jowell
So the design logic is that there's a few different tiers. So quality is, we quality assure the various roles, so the whole quality assurance process for our trainers training. So the quality, we have an accreditation and licensing process for our coaches. And once our coaches are accredited, there's ongoing quality assurance around the coaches and the coaching. And then the same thing for our franchisors. So each partner organisation has a number of standards and processes that they need to meet. So that's in operating the programme itself. And we have teams within Smartstart that support our partner organisations to deliver quality activities, quality processes. So there's a set of standards for each thing and a set of processes for managing and tracking those standards. At the program level for the practitioner, they have to meet a few licensing standards. So when they first get trained, they have to pass what's called a starter license. They then go in field and set up their venues. If their venues meets the health and safety standards, they get what's called a smart space license, which is like a license of the health and safety of the place. And then once they do that, there's a the final level of licensing is called their Program Quality Assurance License. This is done by the coaches who I mentioned have been accredited to do this and are quality assured to do this. But the Program Quality Assurance process involves the coach going to a site, observing the program for a number of hours, and then rating the Smart Start on a number of things. They get a score, and then they have the red, orange, or green traffic light that I mentioned earlier. Those who are green, they are fully licensed as a smart starter and then they fall into a system of just annual checks. So annually, a coach will come and check them and see how they're doing and check that they're still on track with their program and their venue is still safe. If they're orange, they get more deliberate and intentional coaching to support them to improve their practice. If they're red, they get quite urgent support because many of them, if they stay red, we deactivate them. They no longer remain as smart starters. So if they can't transition to we deactivate them. And then, what was the last thing you wanted to say about that? Anyway, but all these metrics are tracked and recorded at the franchisor level, they're managing their program quality assurance and also at the hub level with feedback given to the network around how they're doing on these metrics.

34:13 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. So we are moving on to Section C, Practitioner Innovation and Agency. You've spoken about how young practitioners are reshaping the care economy.

34:27 - Justine Jowell
How did you design the Smart Start model to enable practitioner innovation rather than just So I think, I'm not sure we got that right, but I think the important part of making sure that you really require only a few minimum standards to be met helps move away from a compliance mentality. So making sure that what we were trying to ask for was a few key pieces of quality rather than that, you know, everybody's program looks exactly the same or that they, you know, everybody runs the same activity on this day. To have a structure that everyone supported, but within that there was flexibility. So for example, we have a daily routine. People choose what activities to do that in their daily routine. They choose what order to do it in. They've got a lot of flexibility in how they run their daily routine. We offer them curricular support material so that they can draw on different ideas, but how they do it is up to them. We also, I guess, rewarded that for many years as a way of inspiring clubs to compete with each other around creativity and innovation and so on. And so they would submit regularly activities and ideas to the league, and then they would get positioned in a table against other competing clubs, and then there'd be winners at the end of the Year. So that also helped to drive innovation and difference. And I think then also just much of our media and the stories we share and the stories we gather, which a lot of taboos, a lot driving and part of it are deliberately about trying to elevate innovation difference, but not in traditionally affluent areas. So it's showing what's possible in spaces. So how quality is possible in spaces that would otherwise, you know, maybe seen as then, you know, looking poor, but actually there's equality on happening there and how do you participate and innovate. Things like encouraging people to make toys from found materials and celebrating that and sharing the stories of that. And so I think that's been a big part of it. We also do regularly bring all our coaches together, all our trainers together, and a lot of that work, which is where we are at the conference now, is about elevating and celebrating innovation, different approaches, listening to what coaches in the field are saying and trying to adapt the program accordingly.

37:04 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. You've highlighted intergenerational collaboration in ECD. What does that look like in Smart Starts design? How do you create space for younger practitioners to lead?

37:20 - Justine Jowell
I don't think we have a deliberate focus on that at all. I mean I think we just do have of people and young people tend to lead in things like digital support and so often we encourage within clubs that you find people who are strong on different people and draw on the strengths of your different community members and so you often find younger people tend to be, it's a bit of a discrimination, but they tend to be better with the digital tools and support and they tend to be better at that. Many of the older practitioners are much better at parent engagement, marketing, you know, how they support their programs. So I think there's a it is an encouragement within clubs that they learn from each other and they learn from their peers. So that's a strong, and that starts right at training. So in training, we group people already in clubs and encourage them to learn from each other with the idea that everybody has something you can learn from So in that sense, it's a value of what we do, but I wouldn't say we have a strong focus on encouraging intergenerational work.

38:18 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Can you walk me through an example of how feedback from practitioners in the field change program design. What's the mechanism for that?

38:29 - Justine Jowell
Currently the mechanism for that is we do an annual survey of our franchisees to ask them a few questions. Coaches meet regularly with franchisees and we then meet regularly with coaches so we hear back from them. Our trainers in the field write reports after each engagement with people with recommendations and suggestions. And we've also just recently started working with a tool that uses WhatsApp-based voice notes as a way to give input and feedback, and then also the call center as a way. We've also done various pieces of qualitative research, so focus groups over time on specific issues like sustainability or long tenure or parent engagement, and consolidate those learnings and thoughts programming program design. So some of the things that have changed over time because of that, for example. Our early support materials and process for for parent engagement and home learning totally changed. We used to run sort of more workshops. We now support them with family days and materials we used to have. We used to not have materials to go home to the family. We now have added that because of needs in the field. Our curricular support materials also change because of feedback from the field and from coaches. So that is something that has changed over time and I think is part of our ethos going forward as we always want to be informed by what's happening locally, how people are receiving what we do and then adapting it accordingly both for people's experience but also for the outcomes we're trying to achieve.

40:04 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And how quickly do you iterate based on the field feedback? What's the on that process?

40:13 - Justine Jowell
Yeah, I think it totally depends. Sometimes it's quite quick. So sometimes we'll be like, oh, we've seen that people are struggling with curricula, so we change that quickly and immediately. Some things take a much longer time, either because you need the tech systems to actually make the change that they're looking for. So I mean, I think it's probably led, Adaptations around sustainability happened quite quickly once we realized that we needed that support in our system. But maybe some of the slower systems around how we better support people administratively in their programs with the right apps or the right technical solutions, that's been a bit slower. But I think that's because some of those solutions are quite expensive and take time to come online to test. So I think it's been very varied.

41:07 - vuledzani Tshivhase
that talks about building a profession, not just delivering a programme, what does that mean from a design perspective? How do you design for professionalisation?

41:18 - Justine Jowell
So I think partly that's about building status and value in the ECD space. I think For many years, people who worked in preschools or ran small home care groups were seen just as kind of carers without a strong value in what they do. So partly the training and licensing process in SmartSmart helps to give them some containment and an idea that this is actually a value profession. The story sharing that I mentioned earlier, like the media that we create and how we show the face of an early learning practitioner and smart in South Africa, I think also helps with that professionalization. I think there's also quite a lot of work. We haven't been as actively involved in this, but in the EC sector, South Africa, around how one develops the right kinds of qualifications to enable professionalization and to enable a pathway for people. There's many people who found themselves into this work often don't have, sometimes don't even have a trick. So they found themselves in this work. They're often really good at this work, don't have an easy access to traditional professions. So how one supports things like recognition of prior learning and accreditation of short courses is a critical piece of advocacy for the sector. We haven't been as involved in that accreditation work and professionalization from the training perspective. We've been more from the sense of how do you help recognize that these are valid programs that offer have a license and a process and that starts to professionalize them as a sector.

43:08 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. The next section focuses on the platform as design. Smartstart increasingly describes itself as a platform, not a program. From a design perspective, what's the difference? How did you design Smartstart to function as a platform?

43:32 - Justine Jowell
I think I tried to explain that earlier but in the earlier days I think we saw the possibility of sort of that you have a cohesive program like Smart Start Daily Routine that has some training and some coaching attached and that that could be sort of taken and delivered by many different organizations. What became critical over time is understanding that actually you needed a platform So a technical platform, a network of partners, a way of working together that would enable all of that. And that's, I think, been the shift is that Smartstart moved more towards how do we become a platform that enables access and scale, even if it's not only the program that Smartstart designed. So it might have other ways of creating access by sharing materials, open source or enabling other organizations to make use of our coaching models or so that becomes the platform piece. It's about how do you enable, how do you build a structure which others can build on? So for example, we pay stipends to a number of our practitioners for the first two years, sometimes trying to unlock greater access to platform we've built around how we can vet someone, take their income and expenses every month, check their child attendance, that's a platform that enables payment of the child per day subsidy that can be used and built on for other spaces if that makes sense.

45:12 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I think the next question also, I think you have partly also answered the next question. The strategic vision talks about transitioning to open platform orchestration, What does that mean for program design? What needs to change?

45:26 - Unidentified Speaker
Can you repeat that one, sorry?

45:28 - vuledzani Tshivhase
The strategic vision talks about transitioning to open platform orchestration. What does that mean for program design? What needs to change?

45:42 - Justine Jowell
Sorry, I couldn't hear the beginning. It was breaking up. I don't know why, but I heard to transition to orchestrations. I think Yes, can you hear me now? Yes, I can hear you. Yeah, so I think in the early days it was really about how do we standardize and get the program delivered with our partners. The orchestration role is trying to say, how might we better coordinate different actors who are all involved in this delivery of ECD? So not just the program, but nutrition, health, further business sustainability support, micro enterprise development. These are all things that are needed to enable ECD. It's not enough just to have a great program. Otherwise, we could just train people and leave it at that. This is not going to achieve access in South Africa. We actually have to help enable the whole sector so that it's a viable business for people that can grow, that can increase quality that parents know and value. All those pieces are part of a larger system that needs to change. And that's more the orchestration role. How do we actually play that role rather than necessarily just the program? And you can see that in our team structure. We have an advocacy team now. We have a partnerships team. We have teams working with other tech platforms, partnership work with government. So it's really about saying we don't just think about delivering the program. We actually think about how do we play a role in supporting and orchestrating in the larger sector.

47:15 - vuledzani Tshivhase
joins well with the next question. If a hundred other organisations wanted to deliver Smart Start's model, what would they need from you? What's the minimum viable platform infrastructure?

47:31 - Justine Jowell
So in our current model which is changing, to be a franchisor you'd go through a due diligence process, you would have to be interested in being part of Smart Start, there would be a training and accreditation and there'd be a to deliver the model. What we're looking about in our current strategy is how do we pull apart some of those pieces so that they're accessible as separate pieces, as well as what parts will be totally open access into the future. So I think those are still questions we're working with Heart Base to deliver, but that's, yeah.

48:01 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what can be franchised or shared? What's the irreducible core?

48:09 - Unidentified Speaker
Sorry, say that again?

48:10 - vuledzani Tshivhase
what can be franchised or shared? It's in connection with the previous question. What can be franchised or shared and what's the irreducible core?

48:22 - Justine Jowell
So, I mean, I think, I don't know that we know the answer to that, but I do think, I do think we want, the thing we don't want ever to compromise is that there's a quality program happening with children. How that gets achieved if it's only through our current training model and coaching, that's some of the things we're exploring. Like, is it possible to achieve that by open sourcing materials and seeing people do it, or offering a different kind of coaching model, or thinking about how, you know, like, there are ways to share and open that up. I think what, for the current delivery of the SmallSelf program, the training and coaching piece is the thing that sits together. And maybe the coaching is the most important, I don't know. We've got to make it really hard to change, but into the future, I'm not sure.

49:20 - vuledzani Tshivhase
The next section is learning and evidence. The 2023 evaluation shows smart start children outperforming national averages. From a design perspective, What program elements do you think drive those outcomes?

49:41 - Justine Jowell
So in the evaluation itself, it pulls out some of the key things. So it pulls out that there's certain pedagogical practices that do that. So I'll have to look at the list here or I can send it to you afterwards. But another important piece is the, so it's some of the practices that the practitioner does. Coaching is a really important one and constructive coaching, so coaching sessions that enable people to deliver that. And so those are some of the critical things, how you get someone to be able to deliver those pedagogical things is probably about the training. But that's also, you know, like, not necessarily was not necessarily totally proven by the evaluation. But it's saying that these, these key, these key behaviours drive child outcomes and gains. And supported by coaching.

50:35 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what has the evidence taught you about your design that surprised you? What worked better than expected and what didn't work as intended?

50:44 - Unidentified Speaker
Is that just overall in design?

50:50 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yes, but more like what surprised you?

51:02 - Justine Jowell
I think you have the ones from earlier on how the model changed and the program changed. What surprised me? I think the power of the brand and the way people have taken and owned purple for themselves in different ways and innovated and made it like it's so different in every that one goes to, like how people have taken and made the program theirs, like how it's actually become a brand that some people value and recognize. I think it was really surprising. And I think the power of networks, like some of the long-serving smart starters and what they have enabled and done, and the coaching network, it's an incredible network of innovative field support staff who are making incredible things happen with limited resources and a lot of time, a lot of pressure. Yeah, so I think those probably were some of the things that surprised me.

52:10 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And how do you measure whether the program design is working beyond child outcomes? What metrics matter to you? To you as a designer?

52:22 - Justine Jowell
So a lot of the qualitative feedback around what's working and not working. Obviously the child outcomes are the final end result of that. Looking at program quality assurance metrics, so seeing if people are still delivering quality programs and then retention rates. Do they feel happy to stay? That's a really important one. Do people start leaving soon, they don't stay, that's a really important metric. And then one that's become really important advice is obviously that people feel like it's sustainable, that they can actually keep doing this work, that it can continue to work in their lives.

53:05 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, so our next section is about looking forward. What are the biggest design challenges for smart starts next decade. What needs to be redesigned to reach a million children?

53:19 - Justine Jowell
I think we've got to figure out what pieces we open access, what pieces we, you know, and whether those have impact, you know, how we reach children with less, I guess. So how do we engage you know, the use of, like, online training, remote support, and give people the tools that they need to operate in fields with less cost and less support. And then the other big thing that I think needs to change is the still continuous change around both the status of ECD practitioners, but also the value of early learning. I think that becomes a really important driver. Once parents know what quality looks they will drive an offload. And once practitioners feel that this is a viable and valuable work to get into and something to do, they will also hold themselves to standards that I think will enable access for more and more children. So, yeah.

54:24 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what do you see innovation happening in Smart Starts model over the next five to 10 years? And what's exciting you?

54:35 - Justine Jowell
So I think what's exciting is some of the possibilities of like AI, I guess. Like, is there ways to support people in a more automated way that's, you know, portable and easy? I think our peer networks could be enabled to use things like more access to digital tools. So like, you know, WhatsApp for clubs to enable them to share and learn from each other. I think that's going to be really powerful. Some of the government changes, like the new lens around registration and the Children's Amendment Act changes, those are going to be powerful things for changing the sector, which I think will be really exciting. Yeah, I think probably those.

55:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And beyond Smart Spot, how do you hope your design approach influences the broader EC sector in South Africa?

55:28 - Justine Jowell
Say that again, sorry?

55:34 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Beyond Smart Start, how do you how do you hope your design approach influences the broader ECD sector in South Africa?

55:41 - Justine Jowell
I mean I think I hope that we one can learn from each other around how we are learning about establishing new sites because I think that is one of the big differences maybe between us and other ECD organisations, many of them are supporting quality and in existing sites and how they do that well. I don't think many are thinking through the whole process of what does it take to establish a new site and help it sustain itself. So hopefully I think those programme approaches will be beneficial to the sector around in other spaces and in other ways establishing new ECD programmes and new sites.

56:26 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And looking back over the past 10 years, what design achievements are you most proud of

56:32 - Justine Jowell
I think building something in collaboration with partners and building that something that also draws on the assets and the capabilities existing in our communities. Like we have in many of our programs we're working with, if we're not establishing purely new, we're working with oftentimes people who've been doing this work very unrecognized for a long time as childcare and giving them the opportunity to step into this as something that has value, get just a few extra skills that enable them to run a quality program for children. And then really building on that unbelievable sort of asset we have in this country of incredibly committed, passionate, mostly women who are wanting to do something better for children in their communities and have a business and an income in the same time. And that we can actually help meet that place for people. So not just that we can support them to do that. We might also be able to support them into small businesses where they're running their program that in some way is supporting them economically as well. So it's that mix of really enabling healthy spaces for children that are nurturing and positive, but then also for those practitioners that there's a healthy, positive environment for them that we can support.

58:06 - vuledzani Tshivhase
We have just three more questions left. What was the hardest design trade-off you had to make? Where did you have to choose between competing goods?

58:22 - Justine Jowell
I can't think of the hardest. I can only say it's a constant design challenge because I think because we're trying to always think about scale, there's always a balance of like, how do you do less but still have the same outcomes? So there's constantly some challenges there. Like it would be amazing if you had one coach supporting 10 and they could, you know, give them the best possible support. Or it would be amazing if we could give everybody a container with a set-up classroom and a jungle gym on the outside, you know? So it feels like we're constantly making trade-offs for the greater access that are like saying, so how do we find, how do we enable quality with the minimum? Least we can do so that we can reach more. So I think it's a constant, I wouldn't call it a trade off, but it's a constant balancing of that thing that needs to happen all the time in our design vision. I can't think of one that's been particularly terrible.

59:30 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And what have you learned about designing programs for scale, quality and sustainability that you wish you had known in 2015?

59:47 - Justine Jowell
It takes lots of iteration and building in lots of feedback loops. So that one has to make sure one has built into anything you design lots of time testing that design, hearing from people, figuring out what works and what doesn't work in different places. Context is so important and that's the lot of the insight and even the solutions are going to come from the lower context and that I think we kind of knew that we started there but investing enough time and making sure that that's a robust part of the feedback loops in your design is something that I think we've had but it's been quite so I think that what we're doing is how do we get tighter and tighter feedback loops and closer and closer to the context and where the program is being delivered.

1:00:44 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And lastly, if you could say one thing to other program designers working on social impact at scale, what would it be?

1:00:57 - Justine Jowell
No idea. You can't ask me that question at the end of an hour at the end of this day. I was on the 6 o'clock flight this morning. You gotta ask me, I don't know. Don't have an answer there.

1:01:12 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Not even like one small little thing, not even a phrase.

1:01:16 - Justine Jowell
Ask Grace. Grace is going to tell you.

1:01:22 - vuledzani Tshivhase
OK, thank you so much for your time. Thank you for making the time. This has been incredibly valuable, very insightful. Thank you so much.

1:01:34 - Justine Jowell
Thank you. Thank you for making the time at the end of the day and accommodating my difficult time schedule. So really appreciate that. I hope you get to do all the family stuff you need to do and everything else. But cool. Thanks a lot.

1:01:46 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much. Bye everyone.


Provincial partnerships, Dadisai and Thandeka
9:08 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Oh, okay. My name is Vuledzani. As you might know that we are writing the Smart Starts 10-year report, and we would greatly, greatly appreciate your input. You've been central to how Smart Start expanded across all nine provinces over the past decade, so we would greatly appreciate your input and thank you for making the time.
9:40 - Thandeka
No, it's our absolute pleasure. Happy to do that.
9:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
OK, I can't differentiate between that is I and Thandeka. I don't know if.
9:48 - Thandeka
So you can see at least for the first part. So I'm Thandeka.
10:01 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you, Thandeka. I am very good. OK, good. Thank you. If you are comfortable with keeping the camera on, it's cool. If not, then that's fine. I have my colleague with me, Lante. He's just here to observe. Thank you so much for the time. When I do ask the questions, please try and keep it concise and specific because we do have like a lot of questions. And if you feel like, if I'm asking Thandeka a question and you feel like you have, Dadisai has more to add on the question, your mother will come to input as well. Okay, so I am ready to start and the first few set of questions are directed to Dadisai. Oh, I need to also include that I am recording the meeting and I have a note for the purpose of record keeping and report writing. I hope that is okay with you guys.
11:06 - Thandeka
Yes.
11:07 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, so the first set of questions are for Dadisai and if Thandeka has anything to add on, you're more than welcome to. Okay, take us back to the early Provincial partnership efforts. What was it like trying to build relationships with Provincial governments when Smart Start was still proving itself?
11:34 - Dadisai Taderera
I think that might be a tender question, but maybe to give context, I don't know if you already know this, but our original efforts were targeted...
11:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Sorry, can we have... Tawa, can you please mute? Yes, thank you. Yes.
11:54 - Dadisai Taderera
Is that better? Yeah, there we go. So our earliest efforts were targeted towards mostly the national government and also like municipalities and the like, I think in the last three years, how long? I think in the last three years or so is when we really started having a focused look and focused, uh, approach to Provincial governments.
12:29 - Dadisai Taderera
Okay, I can't.
12:30 - Thandeka
I can also just add a day. That's funny. To be at my understanding is before I got here. So just before I started in my role, which is really to secure partnerships with the Provincial departments of education. The function shift had just happened. So early childhood development had moved from the Department of Social Development to the Department of Basic Education. So Smart Start has always had strong relationships with the relevant departments. They had strong relationships with the Department of Social Development. So when that move happened, you know, I think for a while it made sense for Smart Start are to also sort of step back and allow the Department of Basic Education to figure itself out. And then what came during that period is a very strong relationship that was formed between Smart Start and the National Department of Basic Education, as I mentioned. So when I came in, I think the Department of Basic Education had now had some time to sort of find itself, you know, in terms of now having ECD under its ambit. And my role, I think, was then to really start from scratch, sort of building relationships with the departments. What was key, because Smartstart we work with implementing Partners, you know, our implementing Partners within the different regions, within the different provinces, have very strong relationships already. Well, some of them have very strong relationships. Some of them have, you know, relationships with the department. So we had to really rely on them and to sort of build those relationships as much as possible. So the need to have the Provincial departments really came so that we sort of operationalize the relationship that we have with the National Department of Basic Education, which really focused on law reform, making early childhood development, the legal side of it, attainable and doable for early childhood development practitioners. And that that we had to also have a view or a program that would then help us to sort of operationalize, you know, the policy changes. So the big focus was really around registration. It was around, you know, supporting quality for early childhood development programs on the ground. Those were the the main things that we were looking at. So it's evolved a little bit so, but maybe let me pause because I feel like I'm giving too much information.
15:43 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, which province was the first real breakthrough? And what made them say yes? The first real breakthrough and what made them say yes? They want to.
15:57 - Unidentified Speaker
The real breakthrough.
16:01 - Dadisai Taderera
I think we are still in the process of getting real, like you say, real breakthroughs. I think where we are seeing the strongest sort of alignment or vision alignment is in routing and also in the Northern Cape and to some extent the Western Cape. I think they've been different breakthroughs in those provinces that would have a significant impact on our, you know, on the outcomes for children. But it's still a process because I think like Chandika says, because of the function shift and in the last, two years or so, there's been a strong focus on ECD. And so it has put a lot of pressure on the Provincial education departments to say how do they, you know, how do they give effect to the new national strategy, which also has a strong emphasis on universal access to quality education. I think if you know, like from the history, of basic social development, I mean, welfare, they looked at it from a welfare perspective, you know, so it's not really for everyone, you know, it's like, okay, who is on the margins, but I think what the function shift did and opened up was the idea of universal access to quality early learning, which the government has now committed to, you know, as a right to education. So I think that is really you know, like those external factors have been critical for the relationship building because we are not trying to convince them anymore of, you know, why this is important to provide quality early learning. What we are now trying to partner with them on is on the idea of how, how do we then achieve universal access? How do we create and support them? You know, because we have been developing the systems and we've been, you know, working on the program, and we've seen what works at scale. And so we are now partnering on how do we support them to give effect to that vision of the department.
18:37 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, you mentioned that you're still in the process of building those partnerships. But I was wondering, if you can identify a moment when Provincial partnerships shifted, when provinces started seeing Smart Start as a partner, rather than just another CEO? I mean, NGO, sorry.
18:59 - Unidentified Speaker
Speak about North West.
19:06 - Thandeka
Yeah, so yeah, probably I think North West is also an authority. I think in my time, what I've noticed is that when the departments really understood the importance of expansion, I think that's where we've been able to have those breakthroughs and have those meaningful partnerships. So that, as I mentioned, Northwest. And I think it's noteworthy, because that one is even a historical partnership that started with VSD in the Northwest, and then was taken over by the Department of Basic Education. And I think their realization there was, you know, we don't, we need to expand early learning services. And Smart Starts becomes the partner that comes to mind, because that's what we focus on. We focus on building new programs and reaching the children that are not being reached yet through the existing early learning programs. And I think in housing, the department also sees that importance as well, particularly because of the migration into the province. There's a lot of children who they are unable to reach, particularly in informal settlements. In their context, you know, they've really identified Smartstart as the partner to help them in those areas. And I mean, those are also areas where, I mean, there's high poverty rates. You won't necessarily find a lot of NGOs in those communities. I think provinces like the Northern Cape, even the Western Cape, Free States, they grapple contextually with the issue of, you know, vastness. So children are in places that are very far from the urbanized areas within their provinces. And so they've, I think they've identified some of that partner that can really support them in getting to those places because it's very difficult for them. I mean, they struggle even in the Eastern Cape as an example, struggles with like transport, you know. So the model that we have, where we partner with NGOs that are already existing within those communities, I think it really helps us in being able to stretch ourselves. And I think the next best thing now is really thinking more deeply with the departments as well as our implementing Partners about those critical areas where nothing is happening where there's no early learning services and where, you know, children, there are children but they're not able to gain any stimulation or early learning support.
22:16 - vuledzani Tshivhase
As much that operates in all nine provinces, urban Kauteng, rural Eastern Cape, everywhere, how do Provincial Partners differ, can you give us an example of how you had to adapt your approach?
22:33 - Thandeka
You want to answer first? So one of the big Unmute please.
22:55 - Dadisai Taderera
We are playing games. You have to now mute your computer. Okay, so what we are seeing is that the context is critical to the kinds of, to the ways that we partner. So for instance, you know, in some provinces they see the gap really lies. And like, you know, the starting conversation is often, we want you to help us to reach these children that are hardest to reach, you know. So, for instance, in Gauteng, and it's also aligned to what their Provincial priorities are. So, for instance, in Gauteng, they've got a strong focus on townships, hostels, and informal settlements, right? And there are a lot of children in those communities, and they are also underserved communities. So in terms of all services, including the provision of ECD. So the starting question is, how do we get to these children, right? And what we then do, you know, we use that as a window to say, okay, that's our starting conversation. But what about all the other children, even in other communities that are, you know, not being currently served. So helping them understand what the data actually says and where the children are and where the access gap really is, then becomes important. Based on what they see, what their own priorities are, we then, you know, it becomes a conversation around what can we do and how can we support them. In places like the Northern Cape and Western Cape, they already, like in the they have a strong system of working with non-governmental organizations through their SSO model, which is the social services organization model. So they then, through their own data and modeling, say, OK, these organizations must go to these communities. But then we also bring a perspective around helping them understand And beyond just, you know, closing the gap, there are other issues that also affect practitioners and the sustainability of programs. And for instance, like in the Western Cape now, one of their big things is nutrition as a safeguard for early learning. So, you know, depending on the provinces, you know, like what the context is, what kind of resources they have, that is always the starting point of, okay, we have sort value proposition to all of them but it also has to be responsive to what does the local context say in the northern in the northwest as Thandeka said we have a historical partner where they said there's an you know this their communities are underserved they're not enough organizations and so how can we help them to create new access for all children in the northwest being one of the poorest provinces you know in South Africa so we then had a service level agreement where we actually create new access in various communities that we co-identify as having the highest levels of you know children that are underserved and so it's different it's really based on you know what is the context and also sometimes you know it's of the provinces, right? And that also plays a part. How invested are they in the work? And also the wider leadership within the province. If the premier and the MECs are also supportive and the heads of department are supportive of the ECD mandate, then you see that the Provincial ECD directors who we work a lot with in their departments are then also more open to say, look, how do we actually make this work? And how do we meet our target? So it's really, all this to say, it's a combination of, you know, various complexities, including really understanding what the context is, responding to that context, understanding also, you know, what their constraints are in terms of, you know, sometimes it's like, okay, then we need to shift the mindsets of officials to help them see why, you know, their role is in ensuring universal access and how we can support that vision. Does that answer your question directly?
27:35 - vuledzani Tshivhase
It does. Thank you so much. The next section focuses on enabling scale. Smart Start grew from 29 children to 152,000 plus over 10 years. How did Provincial partnerships make that scale possible? Can you walk us through a specific example?
28:03 - Thandeka
Maybe you can come in with a specific example, Deep. I think over the years, our people on the ground, so the people who are actually implementing the program, coaches, field officers, and I think even the program managers, they've built really good relationships at district level. A lot of them have built really good relationships with district officials. So, I mean, for provinces, districts, that's where the rubber hits the road, where for the provinces, you know, they actually implement the support for early childhood development. So, I mean, from colleagues who have been here even way before I got sheltered as I got here, I think the great lesson is just how they've taken time to build those relationships with district officials, making them understand the importance of early learning, increasing services, making them understand the importance of providing home-based care, because home-based care is a critical, it's critical in failing, right? Our national integrated ECD policy identifies being able to provide support from home and community-based venues as, you know, one of the leaders to universalizing early learning. And this has required a shift from the district officials because for them, ECD traditionally has to be offered in a brick and mortar ECD center, you know, where you have many little toilets for the kids, you know, and you have beautiful rooms, you know, colorful and everything like that. But that doesn't really speak to the context of the communities that we go in. When we go into our communities, we find that venues are a problem, you know, space is a problem. So for us, I think being able to build those relationships with district officials and really make them see them importance of being able to provide support from the home and community based venue setting, um, has been critical in, um. Supporting how far we've scaled. Um, I think an example would be. Maybe mid ball. Um and I think, yeah, so I've in that, you know, there was such a close relationship, um, that was built. Um, they that, um. The local municipality actually supports, um, the day mothers were offering the early learning program for all their homes. You know, they provide them with a stipend. Um and as they grow, they all then they also then support them with venues. Um, so to find bigger processes and are able to access the subsidy from the Department of Basic Education, you know, that's when they sort of let them go and hand them over to the Department of Basic Education. So, I think that's one example. I don't know if there's another one that you could share.
31:25 - Dadisai Taderera
I would say that one of the critical Partners, I mean, it's not directly, you know, Partners that we work with directly as a partnership department, but our implementing Partners have been critical to us actually reaching such a wide, large number of children. So we work with 14, 13 Partners over the last 10 years, I think they've been 16 and three are not working with us anymore. But I think these Partners have been critical in terms of really helping us to reach every province. You know, and reaching these 150,000 children. We couldn't have scaled, you know, to that extent without these Partners. So that has been critical. But I think what has also been really crucial through those partnerships is also partnering with the local communities. And where we have gotten it right, it has also accelerated our reach. So I'm thinking here of, you know, our partnerships with traditional authorities in the, in Limpopo, who actively also help us, you know, they, they not only partner with us, you know, but they see their role in actually ensuring that every child is reached, right? So they support the coaches and teams on the ground with back to school campaigns, making sure no is left behind and every child is registered in a centre. So that creates demand, right, for the programs and it's the same in KwaZulu-Natal as well, in Zululand, in the tribal areas. We had a very strong relationship with the late King Mongosutu, no, King Prince, yeah, but the late King King as well. Yeah, and he was the one who helped us to really get started, you know, and work in KwaZulu-Natal. So when our Partners don't see us as delivering a program, but see us as Partners in helping them achieve their own goals. I think same in the example that Thandeka gave of Lesotho and Midwell municipalities. The municipality did not just partner with us, they saw their own role in delivering quality early learning and those are the most powerful partnerships, you know, where it's not just us saying how can you help us, but in really understanding what's the shared value between us. How can we help you reach the, you know, and do the things that you care about, you know, so how do we educate our children, how do we improve the lives of our people. So it's at the core of it, understanding the social justice element of the work that we do. When they see their role as enablers and catalysts of that, I think that's really when we are able to multiply from just what we can reach to how can others help us. And I think it also speaks to now our Partners are also now partnering with other community-based organizations. And I'm thinking here in the Eastern Cape, you know, our Partners, Kululeka, now partner with other small organizations that are also rooted in certain communities they can't reach. If you understand the geography of the Eastern Cape, it's so vast. And so for their coaches to reach all of those places becomes difficult. So also deepening the partnerships in the communities where we can't reach, you know, those small community-based organizations like Laita, Small Projects Foundation, and I think the same in Pumalanga as well. They are partnering with inflow for community-based organizations, I think. You know, so those also become critical in really reaching, you know, those that are at the margins where there are no services and where it's hard for even ourselves So I think looking at all of those partnerships in their entirety, I think all of it has been instrumental and helped us to get to the 160,000 children. And I think they'll still be critical. They are becoming more critical. And I think this is why the partnerships department was also created. How do we enable others to see their role in delivering quality early learning and how do we unlock that and, you know, partner from that perspective of, you know, the shared value for all of us.
36:25 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And how does the ECCE Outcomes Fund change what's possible?
36:34 - Unidentified Speaker
You mean? Yes, the Education Outcomes Fund.
36:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
How does it change what's possible?
36:45 - Dadisai Taderera
Absolutely. So the EOF fund, its mandate is to test new public-private partnerships, right? So as you know, it's a partnership between Department of Basic Education, UNICEF through the Outcomes Education Fund, and also private sector who have pledged money into this. So what it does So government has this ambitious target to say, how do we reach all the children? And we know that almost 1.2 children are not in any programs. So what EOF is allowing us is to test what are the true costs of starting up supporting new and also supporting existing programs to deliver quality early learning. So for our part, with our Partners, we are going to be delivering in Limpopo, KZN and also the Eastern Cape. And, you know, they've chosen some of the really poor municipalities. And so it's been a process of saying, what happens if we work together, you know, with one goal and invest in these women okay predominantly women and will this really achieve the outcomes that we we want and so over the next three years until 2028 we'll be rolling out the programs and you know then tracking the children from you know from this year until 2028 and seeing what happens so I think it's a of about just over 12,000 children and 1,015 practitioners, if my numbers are right, but don't quote me on it, we can supply the actual numbers. So over the next three years, it will be tracking these children. And then, you know, look, then there'll be an ELOM and early learning outcomes, you know, measure that will be done to see, did these children reach their milestones? You know, are they developmentally on track in terms of their cognitive development so you know and also their physical development as well. So I think it's a really exciting way of saying how do we leverage resources you know from different sectors to fund a national priority and I think it has been a process of you know if in last year there was the Lekotla that was called and the really, you know, put his support into it to say early learning and, you know, getting the foundational learning is a national priority. And if we're going to change the outcomes of, you know, children's and families from really the poorest, we cannot address that inequality without looking at, you know, how we invest in early learning. So I think it's really testing and developing the evidence to then really roll out that kind of partnership to support more and more children until we reach the milestone. And I would add as well that what we're also seeing, what that has done is create a stronger coherence in the ecosystem to say all of us working towards this common goal. And I think the leadership of the department, the National Department of Basic Education, has been critical. You might have heard that there is now a blueprint that government has, you know, published. And I think all of that is, you know, the EOF, the blueprint, it all speaks to how do we collectively work towards this as a national priority and work together. And I think there's been emphasis at the Lekot at the Lokotla last year, at the Lokotla this year, that early learning really, if it's a priority, what does it mean in terms of public-private sector partnerships? And that's the only way that we're going to achieve that. So for us, it's exciting because then it means that it creates a strong opportunity to continue. So we are leveraging a lot of that in terms of our own partnership building for the next 10 years.
41:21 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And how do Provincial partnerships help Smart Start maintain quality as it scales?
41:28 - Thandeka
Sorry, I keep on having to manage things on Trevor's laptop, so I'm so sorry. I just wanted to briefly add that I made a really great point about how it helps us to identify our roles in the ecosystem, right, of ECD. I think specifically for us, it will help to establish what that formal relationship needs to look like between implementing Partners like Smart Start and our Partners, as well as the district. So it would really open up their eyes to what is their role and how can we work together when we've decided to universalize early learning access. Which is very, very important. And the fact that also, I think we're going to be using home-based venues. Yeah, that would also, that will also be something really great for the sector to see departments actually working with NGOs in supporting home-based early learning in that way.
42:39 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you. Thank you for adding that. How do, How do Provincial partnerships help Smart Start maintain quality as it scales?
42:54 - Dadisai Taderera
I think this is a question that the program and platform team will be able to give you more insights. But I think what it does is that for us, there is an importance in terms of unlocking government Right. So it's important for for resources to flow to assure quality, because one of the challenges is that, you know, no one has really been showing or highlighting what are the true costs of starting up early learning programs. Right. And so that's our biggest contribution. We have been able to show the full value chain of, you know, delivering a quality early learning program. And so without nutrition, without, you know, infrastructure support, and also supporting practitioners, every other sector, we talk about startup costs, you know, and what those look like, And yet, for years in the early learning sector, that startup and, you know, was always left to the entrepreneurs themselves to see to it to start until such a time they are able to register for a subsidy. So I think for us, what has been crucial in terms of the partnerships element is to make visible what it actually takes to start and sustain a quality early learning program and to retain these women in the system. So really emphasizing the need for, you know, startup support. At the moment, as you would have known, the big focus is on the mass registration drive. And again, it's a great systemic, you know, intervention, but it also makes visible the challenge that, you know, government wants to know them once they've started, but no one is really investing except for Smart Start and others who are really focused on, you know, how do we create new So I think, yeah, from a partnership's perspective, by showing the true costs and trying to leverage the resources that government has, it contributes to quality because then we can leverage resources around infrastructure support, we can leverage resources around nutrition, and we know that nutrition is critical to cognitive development of children. So no matter the quality program we may deliver, if children are hungry, they're not able to live on that. So I think those for us, from a partnership perspective, are the important elements to ensuring, you know, quality. And also these are now costs that, you know, we cannot sustain as an organization through fundraising. Government has to take full responsibility. And I think that is also what is at the core of our partnership proposition with Provincial departments of education, who hold the budgets. And are responsible for the actual implementation.
46:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. So the next section focuses on challenges and learning. What's been the single hardest challenge in building Provincial partnerships? Partnerships over the past decade?
46:11 - Thandeka
I think being able to align around our priorities So that as I spoke about, you know, our shared value, you know, I think it hasn't always been obvious. And I think we had to work, really get to understand government. So we define value proposition and a shared value that could work for the both of us. You know, what I found was that, you know, when you go to government and you are already talking to them about, you know, universalizing so important, new programs are so important, they're just thinking about registering the existing programs, you know, they not even, they haven't had that mind shift to say, oh, wow, actually, it's so critical for us to be thinking about new access at this point, because they're just trying to juggle their immediate targets. And those targets are usually on registration, you know, those brick and mortar ECD centres that I spoke about. So finding that alignment was, it was very difficult. So I think the work in facilitating that mind shift for government has been really important and it has happened at different layers. Right? So, like I mentioned, you know, we have a partnership with the National Department of Basic Education and there's a lot of work done there, you know, so that the National Department of Basic Education gets the importance and starts to then lead on those policies, you know, that puts universalizing early learning at the forefront. So, I think we are, we there, we've also had to learn to prioritize or to magnify, you know, the things that we do that are a priority for government. So quality for them, supporting quality within the existing programs has been like something very critical for them. And I think we've had to show them, you know, how we support quality and how we think we can work around supporting quality for the ecosystem with them. The mass registration drive has been a critical lever for us at Smart Start because then government had, they initiated a program for, to register programs, you know, a phased one where the programs would be sort of introduced, get to know government and then you can move on to a stage where you can be registered and they have like a set of requirements there And so they really needed to work with NGOs with that particular program, with the mass registration drive. So Smart Starts, I think we've also put our hand up and been very supportive to government in making sure that, you know, we deliver on targets and we have that focus in terms of registering our own Smart Starts or franchises, but as well you know, practitioners in the sector that do not necessarily use the Smart Start program. We've also been supporting them as well. So I think we've found alignment around certain aspects, some which for them are operational and very immediate. And they've also took the time to listen to us around, you know, what are our strategic imperatives and how we would like to partner them. With them around them, around those strategic imperatives.
50:27 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I'm realizing that we don't have a lot of time.
50:30 - Dadisai Taderera
I think one critical thing there is just the mindset shift around accepting that home and community-based programs can deliver quality. I think that has been the biggest stumbling block and helping them see that they do. And I think our own child evaluation outcome study was critical to showing them and also taking them on site visits to see the programme and what it can do, you know, in the settings where our practitioners work from, which is mostly their homes and, you know, community venues.
51:15 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. I am realising We don't have a lot of time left anymore. So if you can be very, like, maybe short but detailed in your responses, that would be awesome. The documents mention a subsidy gap, 24-end-a-day government subsidy versus 47-end-a-day actual cost. How does this reality affect Provincial partnerships and Smart Staff's ability to scale?
51:44 - Unidentified Speaker
Please just repeat that for me.
51:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, the documents mention a subsidy gap 24 end-of-day government subsidy versus 47 end-of-day actual cost. How does this reality affect Provincial partnerships and Smart Start's ability to scale?
52:06 - Dadisai Taderera
So, I think this is not just a Smart Start issue. I think this is a sector problem and I think I mentioned The true costs of running a program are still not yet reflected in the 24 rent. And remember, the 24 rent only came into effect last year. It was 17 rent for the longest time. So I think there's still a gap. If you look at even school education, the school subsidy is far higher than the subsidy for early learning. And yet, in early learning programs, there isn't even infrastructure support. People are using their private homes and, you know, to the most part private resources. So I think that this is a sector wide and our Partners such as Real Reform have been trying to also raise this that, you know, the true cost of delivering an early learning program must be recognized and government needs to increase the allocation. Yes, we got the 10 billion last year. It's a great starting point, but more still needs And I think that's part of the work we're doing, even through EOF, to really try and show what are the actual costs of running a program.
53:20 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. And how did Provincial partnerships hold up during COVID-19 when that crisis revealed about the strength or fragility of these relationships?
53:36 - Dadisai Taderera
During COVID, we didn't really have Provincial partnerships, you know, especially with the government. I think we had other partnerships with funders and others that helped us to tie the practitioners and to support them, you know, throughout the pandemic.
53:58 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. And the next section focuses systems change. Beyond delivering programs, how have Provincial partnerships helped Smart Start influence the broader ECD system? Can you give us a specific example of a policy or practice that changed because of partnership work?
54:22 - Dadisai Taderera
I think the national ECD strategy was largely influenced by the work that Smart Start had done directly with the Department of Basic Education to help them recognize and bring into the policy framework home and community-based programs, and also to then create a pathway for them to be registered. I think the bronze category in the mass registration drive was really developed to bring in a lot of the Smart Start into the fold. So I think that's one. And I think also last week, well, this week, Monday, the president just signed the children's amendment bill. And I think those amendments will be critical in terms of also recognizing home and community-based, but also recognizing important changes in terms of, you know, early learning programs. And I think Smart Start has had a direct, you know, they were working with the drafters of those amendments through our partnership and MOU with the Department of Basic Education at the national level. So I think those have been critical in terms of really providing change. Right now we are in discussion with Northern Cape Department of Education and Western Cape Department of Education to say how can we support practitioners with nutrition And there's a shift to say, OK, perhaps there's a role for government to pay a nutrition subsidy that can support practitioners to provide nutrition for children even before they have their formal registration. And I think that has also been due to the partnership that we've developed together with our Partners on the ground in the provinces.
56:21 - vuledzani Tshivhase
that. The national government allocated 10 billion for ECD from 2025 to 2027. From a Provincial perspective, partnership perspective, what does that mean and what does it change and what does it change what's possible? How does it change what's possible?
56:49 - Thandeka
So I think firstly it has a positive impact for the eCity practitioners on the ground because I mean it helps them to run their early learning programs a lot better having more income to support nutrition to support the administration and even I think you know the stipending but as that, as I said, I mean, we still have a long way to go, you know, in terms of the 10 billion. So I think on the ground, you know, the positive impact should, will definitely be felt by the practitioners first. But yeah, there's still a lot of, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done, you know, around that 10 billion, getting to all of the practitioners that do need it. Because unfortunately, not all of the practitioners are going to be able to access this funding.
57:53 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. And Smart Start aims to reach one million children. What needs to happen in Provincial partnerships to make that possible?
58:10 - Dadisai Taderera
For us, it's reaching these children on our own, I think what has shifted in our strategy...
58:26 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Hello, I cannot, yes, there's a break in transmission. Oh, I don't know.
58:35 - Dadisai Taderera
Okay, so like I was saying, I think all the wins that we've had in terms of recognition of practitioners, now I've lost my train of thought altogether. What was the question? Oh yeah, reaching one million children, sorry about that, my mind also glitched with the computer. So we have recognized that you know for us it's critical that we are able to enable the ecosystem to collectively reach that one million children. I think we we have shifted our stance somewhat from the early days to saying we will reach these 1 million children, to say we will contribute and enable the ecosystem to reach these 1 million children. And so I think that what this means is that we have been also focusing on how do we lower the barriers to entry and how do we surface the challenges practitioners are facing on the ground so that, you know, other stakeholders can take their own commitment, you know, like their own role in terms of enabling that. So our partnerships, if you think about it, with government have been focused on how do we enable them to see their role and what else they can do to support the children on the ground. So ensuring that all practitioners can be registered. You know, last year there was also a commitment to say how do we support practitioners with infrastructure support right and so there is now an interest infrastructure fund that is also another public private sector you know partnership where there is a private sector fund and also government is putting money into infrastructure so I think really for us the focus is now on how do we really catalyze others to see their critical role and what they need to do to So even the work that we're doing in terms of the red tape reduction at the national level to say, how do municipalities see their role not only as an inspector, but as an enabling of early learning and reduce the barriers to registration at the municipal by reducing the red tape and reducing the cost as a result of registering. Because an important part of the registration process is compiled complying with the municipal bylaws. So what we see is if we are able to do this, more people are able to register. And that means that there's an incentive for people to reach more children. And so what this will do is to catalyze more and more people reaching the right children. I work with Provincial governments around how do we do joint societal planning where we really say, where are the children that are most excluded? And how do we create new access in those areas? So that joint planning is also important, not only for us, but for the ecosystem so that there isn't unnecessary duplication of efforts, that we're all going to the same areas, duplicating, serving the same practitioners. How do we actually, also as an ecosystem, work together in a more structured way that we can, you know, spread our resources to reach all children. And I think if we get this right, I think that is what will be the catalyst for exponential growth for the sector, for us to really close the early learning. So what that also means is we are shifting how we think about our results. We're not just content by reaching one, you know, like the children we are reaching as an organization, but the children by us enabling the ecosystem to.
1:02:25 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, thank you for that. So we have maybe four questions left. I know it's 10 o'clock but let's just try to keep the answers short. Open platform vision, a smart start talks about transitioning to open platform orchestration, enabling other organizations to deliver quality ECD. From a Provincial perspective, partnership perspective, what does that mean? How do partnerships need to evolve?
1:03:05 - Dadisai Taderera
Yeah, I think to a large extent, that's what I answered with my previous question.
1:03:11 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, okay. And what's the unresolved challenge or question about Provincial partnerships that you're still wrestling with?
1:03:34 - Thandeka
I think strengthened relationships with districts remain. And a question. Yeah, because I guess there's challenges, you know, in terms of finding alignment there. There's still a lot of mind shift work that needs to happen. Yeah, I think maybe for me that I'll park it there for time and then I can answer the other ones.
1:04:16 - Dadisai Taderera
I think one of the things is that we are also requiring a different way of partnering from what they used to. And that is challenging, you know, even developing the systems internally to say, okay, one of the questions we get is, okay, so what does this we don't have money to give you and we're like we're not asking for money for ourselves. Our partnership is a strategic partnership where you know you and us have a shared value and we can co-create you know solutions together and so there's still a lot in terms of understanding from a systems change perspective what does government role mean vis-a-vis the role of ecosystem enablers. So I think there's still you know, common, you know, finding that understanding. And sometimes what we've seen is, you know, a lot of the Provincial education departments, one of the things we did as Smart Start was also to bring consultants to the Department of Basic Education that have been helping them to understand what is systems change. And so at the level of the director, sometimes they get it, but they still also resistance within their teams while operating from from a direct service delivery perspective, rather than what needs to change in the system to enable more and others to do more. So I think there's still work to be done around just really finding that and understanding the value proposition that organizations such as ourselves bring.
1:05:50 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. Second to last, when you look back over the decade, Provincial partnership moment or achievement makes you most proud?
1:06:06 - Thandeka
Achievement that makes us most proud? Provincial partnerships. Are you trying to mute? I think that for the provinces that are starting to get For me, that's the biggest achievement. I think in provinces like Gauteng, you know, specifically, they're starting to understand their role in supporting early learning. I've picked it up at director level and even in some of the districts, you know, where they've now come to understand smart starts, you know, our work in creating new access, but they also see how they're supposed to contribute to that. So, yeah, I think for me, the mind shift, being able to achieve or establish that mind shift within the minds of the ECD directors, you know, even though a lot of work is done, for me, I think that's the biggest achievement.
1:07:22 - Dadisai Taderera
Yeah, and I think the acceptance of home and community based for me, that's the biggest, you know, from a lot of the times there was a strong adversarial relationship between ourselves and Smartstart. Smartstart was known as these ones that are just mushrooming everywhere and causing problems, you know, with it for the department. But from that to shifting and saying, okay, we see you, we see the importance of, you know, this home and community base and what these women are doing, and recognizing those practitioners working in home, you know, in their homes, and recognizing the contribution they're making to closing that quality early learning gap. I think for me, that has been a big win. Because, yeah, I think it shifts us in the right direction. Now, At least we're not fighting that battle. We're now looking forward to say, what does it mean? How do we work better with each other?
1:08:19 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. And lastly, what have you learned about building partnerships with government that we should know in 2015?
1:08:38 - Thandeka
Uh, I think, uh, government needs to, I think they need to see themselves. Um, and sometimes it's not, well, maybe we assume like what we know is what they should know. I think I've taken for granted, like going into meetings, you get there, you just start talking from a basis of, okay, these are the important things that everybody obviously who is here is aligned. About, you know, because policy says so, you know, and because we understand the challenges of early learning. But I learned that you have to really take time to understand where they are at, what is their understanding of, you know, the importance of early learning, how it's supposed to be provided, because that's where most of the work had to go, you know. As I spoke about, we facilitated a conversation last year with Smart Start around systems change. And for a lot of the ECD directors or officials, I think that's when things start to make sense and they're able to identify how they can change the entire system. So you really have to understand their level and meet them with they act. And you have to nurture these relationships because a lot of the times, even when you have been able to communicate what's important and you are aligned, they go back to the places of work and already they are focused on the next immediate thing. So you have to constantly find ways to communicate with them, you know, to ensure that, to highlight the importance of the work that we do, you know, whether it's working through other Partners and, you know, creating platforms so that they continuously understand the importance of, you know, the strategic importance of early learning and it being provided through home-based and community-based care. So, yeah, I think for me that's been the most critical learning.
1:10:56 - Dadisai Taderera
You know, I think we were not always confident that government would win. It becomes their priority to find the resources to support the work that we do. Yeah. So I think, yeah, I would say, you know, I wasn't here three years ago, but I would say, I think one of the things that we've become is in our asks and in our demand, not demands, but like in helping them see what their responsibility is. And, you know, as a result, we've seen that resources can be made available when the vision is clear and they understand what their role to enable that vision to become a reality is.
1:11:44 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you both. Thank you, Tahoe. Your partnership work has been central to Smart Start's scale Is there anything else that you feel like maybe we didn't ask that you need to give input?
1:11:58 - Dadisai Taderera
It's also a long game, you know, I think that's one of the things I would leave to say. The partnership development, you know, some of the things, the wins we have had in the last few years have been long in the works, you know, so it's long game and realizing that you have to be, you know, pushing several levers for change, you know, in order to get to this point. So, yeah, partnerships is an important lever, but it would not work without other, you know, critical levers as well, like mindset shifts and, you know, our societal community, how we communicate and the importance of early learning and, you know, advocating for political will, for politicians to really take responsibility. So yeah.
1:12:53 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you so much for making the time again. Thank you for your insights. Thank you very much.
1:13:00 - Dadisai Taderera
And feel free to reach out to us if there's anything we learned. Noted. Thank you so much.

It's just care about what you've got.

0:59 - Unidentified Speaker
Hi, morning Thabo.

1:00 - Unidentified Speaker
Hey Thabo, how are you doing?

1:15 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Can you guys hear me? Yes, we can. How are you? Good, thanks. How are you doing?

1:23 - Unidentified Speaker
I'm good too, thanks.

1:26 - Emmanuel Luthuli
I'll just check on Leslie.

1:40 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, fantastic. Well, while I have you on the line, a quick question. Is there anything that's coming out of the finance guy in terms of documentation? Even if it's half or just a financial statement, I don't mind.

2:22 - Emmanuel Luthuli
I'll check with him again today.

2:24 - Lazola Makhupula
Okay, I appreciate you. Morning, morning, sorry I'm late.

3:41 - Unidentified Speaker
Hi Lazola, how are you?

3:43 - Lazola Makhupula
Good, good, good. How are you doing? I'm all right.

3:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Appreciate the rain.

3:50 - Lazola Makhupula
Yes, yes, please. We planned it.

3:57 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Good morning, Lazola. I'm just going to turn on my camera and switch it off after I introduce myself. Hi, good morning. Hi, my name is Obore Zani. Thank you for making the time for this meeting. As you know, we are in the process of writing the 10 a.m. Smart Start report, so we really do appreciate this time, and we have a few questions for you, and we hope you can give us much detail, but I know we are short for time, and it's not a An hour is not enough to speak about what has happened within Smart Start in the past 10 years. So if you can keep it specific and concise, I'd really appreciate it.

4:50 - Lazola Makhupula
Well, Uludani, I'm new at Smart Start, so I don't know how much I can tell you about 10 years. I'm still on probation, but I will try.

5:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
OK, thank you very much. Can I just request that I turn off my camera? I might be struggling. My network is not stable today, so I'm just going to switch off my camera. You're also welcome to do the same thing.

5:17 - Lazola Makhupula
We love cameras, boss.

5:21 - vuledzani Tshivhase
OK, let's get right into it. OK, the first question for focuses on Platform versus, of the first section focuses on the Platform in action. People hear Platform and Program used about Smart Start. From where you sit operationally, what's the real difference? How does Smart Start function as a Platform? What would break if you tried to as a traditional Program?

6:00 - Lazola Makhupula
So the main difference is about the level, right? A Platform is a space like the foundation or the guardrails for everybody to be able to act. So, I mean, if I make the analogy of normal infrastructure, would be a road, right? And different programs would be the different vehicles that travel on that road. So our intention, and our leadership space in the ecosystem is always to have the means to build the infrastructure, which is the Platform, so that other actors closest to the problem of access to quality early learning can be able to act, which is why at Smartstart we work with now 15 other organizations across the country to be able to deliver access to quality early learning. Otherwise, we would have to multiply ourselves as an organization 15 times if we were to do that in the Program state. So that's the main difference. The main difference is that we create the rails others to be able to act, rather than focusing on doing the acting ourselves.

7:24 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. Walk me through what happens on a typical day across Smart Starts Platform. What needs to function for 15,000 practitioners to deliver quality early learning?

7:40 - Lazola Makhupula
Oh my God, how long do you have On a typical day, and there's two aspects of this, they will be considering somebody who's new, joining into the system, or somebody who's already in the system, and starting a normal day. So I'm going to start with the new person is after they've been recruited, found, trained, and licensed, and all of that, and they're starting to operate with children, then what What a typical day looks like for them is that they get a lot more dedicated support from their coaches because they are new. And they have startup material. So including a play kit that has like a daily routine, they set up their space, the coach helps them to do all of this to brand their practice, prepare for the parent and community engagement work. Now, on a day we have what we call a daily routine with the children, which means that a practitioner has to develop some kind of routine. And the only thing that is standardized is that there needs to be a routine. And the routine looks like 10 in particular items, I think it's 12 now, where you would have story time, you'd have small group, large group activities. In the beginning of greeting time, you have a message board and all of this of things that are pretty standardised in a day, but how you actually go about them is absolutely up to the creativity of a practitioner. So story time, it doesn't have to be a prescribed story, you can tell any story, it can be localised, it can be in Tshivenda, if you are in a vendor speaking area, it can be, you know, up to your own volition on how you actually go about it as a practitioner. Typical day looks exactly like that welcoming children a messaging board that explains to them what the day will look like and there's key pieces of learning there like the weather the day of the week knowing what date and date format look like knowing what specific emojis a smiley face and all of these things look like and say about your day and then you go Now as part of that routine, one of the most important things is food. So thinking about a time for a morning snack or breakfast for some of those that start early and thinking about what lunch will look like, And then the afternoon sessions differ across the country, depending on whether it's a full-time Program, a half-day Program, or how the size of the Program and when actually parents come back. We have practitioners who starts from six and close up at six p.m. We have those that start at eight and close at one. So it differs just based on context. And on a day-to-day basis, that's what your day looks like, And you have an application to help you register, capture attendance register, which is HoonDap. And you have a purple file that helps you do all your administrative work, give you ideas on how you conduct your day. And then you also have a startup subsidy, which is called a stipend for the first 24 months so that you can invest in your business to be able to grow it for at least a two year period. And we always anticipate that is a pathway towards the government subsidy per child per day of 24 hours. And that's what a typical new practitioner would be working towards. As a more experienced practitioner, you already would have your routine. Usually your kids are familiar, obviously, depending on the time of the year. If it's completely new kids, it's slightly different. But what stands out a bit more about these kinds of practitioners is that a coach doesn't visit you as much and support is not coming from the top down to you, it's coming, it's a request from the bottom up. So we have a call Centre, we have a WhatsApp board, there's your coach to be able to reach out to. And then obviously a wider ecosystem out there that Smartstart might have nothing to do with. And you can go and reach out to those people out of your own volition. So that would be the main difference around an existing practitioner, but on a day-to-day basis, it looks exactly like that. You go through your routine, spark your own creativity, moments for nutrition, and then you have moments for doing some of your administrative work, which they are digital and some paper-based tools to be able to do that. And you capture your finances and all of those kinds of things to be able to see how profitable your business is.

12:54 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. I feel like you've somehow managed to touch on most of the questions I'm still going to ask you. The 2023 evaluation highlighted coach fidelity and daily Program adherence as critical to quality. Tell me how the coaching system actually works at scale. How do 107 coaches which is support 15,000 practitioners?

13:24 - Lazola Makhupula
Technically they don't. I know that's a that's a very shocking statement, but they don't because they couldn't. They play a part in coaching, so coaching is a mechanism of support, but it's not entirely on a coach. One of the biggest things that we have as form of support and coaching is the call Centre. Most practitioners, when they have issues either with the tools, with the apps, they want to understand how registration works and all of these things, they can always reach out to our call Centre and they don't have to call into the call Centre. They can always request a call back from the call Centre. That's the first moment of coaching that's virtual and a bit more scalable because it reaches a lot more people without the logistics of getting there. Then the second layer is that we have these groups in WhatsApp and chatbots to be able to engage via text or voice note and get real-time support from the kind of person that you want to get support or coaching from It could be a peer, it could be an actual coach, it could be a field officer, or it could be involving other parties like the government, social workers, and environmental health and safety people, depending on where you are. And that's another moment of coaching. Then there's the actual human being who is a coach. And as I said, there are different levels at which a coach is then able to do things in person. And they tend to focus their support on the people that need it the most. So we have like our PQA dashboards, for example, to PQA's Program quality to see if somebody is in the red, green or orange zone. And for those that are orange and red, they get more in-person support than those that are green as an example. And then obviously the coaches also are very via phone, via WhatsApp, and in that way, without them having to be physically there, they can support a lot more people. And then in instances where we get some of the tracer indicator or early warning indicators of them needing to be in-person support, they do it. But for the new practitioners specifically, we provide much more routine dedicated support in person, at least in their first year so that they can get much familiar with the programme much quicker and get dedicated personalised support.

16:12 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And just to add on to the question, how has coaching evolved over the past 10 years?

16:22 - Lazola Makhupula
It has evolved in exactly this way that in the past you could have coaches as human do all the work and be able to touch every practitioner whenever they need. But obviously when you scale, you can't. You can't grow that the equivalent of growth of practitioners, right? It becomes difficult to do so. The evolving of the coaching function was to add then virtual support so that we can support practitioners in a hybrid way. Approach, which is why a call Centre was introduced, which is why chatbots like FundaApp, and what are groups and communities were also introduced so that we can have other moments of coaching that do not depend on the human being that is a coach. And in that way, there's 360 support for the coach. And then for those that use FundaApp, for example, there's extra coaching in there because there is e-learning materials that they can access free of charge. That is reversible to us and then the app has a lot of other materials that practitioners can access as well for their own development and their own learning. So coaching has evolved in that aspect is that you get the support and capacity development regardless of interaction with an actual coach.

18:05 - vuledzani Tshivhase
You have somehow managed to also answer the next question but okay I'll Read out the next question but I will tell you maybe which specific areas to focus on because I feel like you've answered it somehow. How does technology enable Platform operations? What role do data systems play in 15,000 practitioners, but I would like for you to elaborate on maybe data that has revealed something important you wouldn't have known otherwise. What's the tech investment needed to reach 1 million children? Yeah, so that's what maybe you can focus on.

18:44 - Lazola Makhupula
I'm afraid of being quoted on the answers that have going to give on this but I'll give them because I can always deny knowing you because we are not on video. So tech in the Platform is exactly the infrastructure that we as smart start are focused on building for the ecosystem and we do this in two ways. One is directly using ourselves as a guinea pig to say something can work Then we show that it can work. Then the rest of the ecosystem can buy into something like that. The second piece is that we work with partners like ECD Connect, which is part of DGMT, to be able to then use the lessons that we have learned from ourselves to create solutions for the ecosystem. Because in South Africa, In the ECG space, there's very few digital tools that exist. Some of the most powerful ones are closed systems, which means there's a friction into getting into them. We wanted to create a situation where we cater for what the smart start network needs and how it actually operates as a network, but we also cater for others in the ecosystem, whether that's other organizations, don't want to be part of the network, or independent practitioners who don't rely on the support of a specific organization to be able to work. And in doing that, the combination of Funda App and ECD Connect then allows people to, where you have organization that can white label an app similar to our Funda App, or your practitioners that can access ECD Connect to help them run their practice using a digital and they get the same kind where similar kind of support. The only exception that side is that you don't. You're not guaranteed in actual human being coach, but you still have a call Centre. You still have the app that can support you and you still have the prompts to be able to create this virtual support spaces. And all of that in between, so it makes. It makes life quite easy. For people to be able to move. The other thing is that through that Smart Start has even been recognized by the DBE through the blueprint to then play a role for the digital transformation of the sector to see how we can create the infrastructure now for the entire sector in partnership with the DBE and not just this Platform, but to ensure that all other platforms can be able to drive, which is a really, really, really key thing for us to have. That is one of the pathways to the one million children. And to get to one million children, I would be ill-informed to try and give you a budget of what it would cost. But it cannot us the same amount of money that Smart Start, ECD Connect, and an organization like GrowECD, for example, have had to invest to develop three different solutions. We need to figure out a situation where we use the existing and then the rest of the infrastructure that others can plug and play into. And for me, that's the true cost of development. From my previous life, we did this for community health care workers. It took about $2 million to get that right. I don't know what I don't know about the ECD sector in the first place. So, you know, it's a little bit rough to say how much it would cost. But these things tend to cost in the region of between 20 and about 35 rands to build. But once you build them, then that is an embedded cost. And then I think the biggest function that's not catered for in the ecosystem is that then human in the space, like how do you then because we've shown that in our outcomes that in the most difficult to get to areas, having a coach is an absolutely critical thing to getting good Program quality and getting good child outcomes. So figuring out how to multiply that without necessarily multiplying human beings is going to be critical and technology is one of the most powerful pathways to do that, to do a hybrid system.

23:56 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that insight. The next section focuses on quality at scale. Smart Start has grown from 29 152,000 children while maintaining quality. The 2023 evaluation shows track 65% versus 46% national average. How do you maintain quality while scaling that fast? What's your left hook?

24:32 - Lazola Makhupula
It's the people. I mean, quality assurance is not a moment in time. You need to build it in your Program across different parts of the life cycle of a practitioner and different levels of quality Like, we don't only quality assure the Program itself, but there's a quality assurance system for the coach, there's a quality assurance system for the trainer, and everything in between. There are quality assurance systems for the technology itself. So you need to make sure that quality assurance is embedded in culture to be able to do that, and you need to find the right moments that are context-specific to be able to do quality assurance in a meaningful way, And then you build a case for targeted or hyper-personalized support based on those moments of quality assurance and engagement. So for us, every single engagement is a potential quality assurance moment, and we use it to be able to inform quality assurance, especially given the volatility of the specific directory to take as an organisation to focus primarily on quintiles one and two.

25:54 - vuledzani Tshivhase
You say every moment is a what? Quality, a moment for you to check quality. How do you catch quality problems before they become widespread? Is it during those moments?

26:10 - Lazola Makhupula
It is during those moments. So as I'm saying that We try to contain the system because quality assurance is about the one-on-one engagement with the practitioner. Then there is a wider system which we engage five to eight practitioners in a club. Then you could be looking at that at even bigger, multiple clubs or a whole area or a town or a province. We try to contain it at the one-on-one engagement. Before it starts spilling up to a club, because we use that one-on-one engagement to identify, then resolve a quality assurance worry. And then in a club system, then that engagement can be shared. So as a format to prevent from others experiencing the same experience. And that's one of the best ways is to be able to really contain it at the and continue to what is still small. And then as I'm saying that one of the critical pieces of our design is to focus on quality assurance rather than improvement, which is the preventative side of things. So we have all of these tools and licensing moment and capacity building and technical support systems to ensure that prevent things from happening. And then on the flip side, we also have different mechanisms to ensure that once we've identified a quality assurance issue, then we can have an improvement process to ensure that we take it back to the preventative side.

28:00 - vuledzani Tshivhase
And adding to that question, what's a non-negotiable for quality versus what's adaptable?

28:07 - Lazola Makhupula
Come again?

28:08 - vuledzani Tshivhase
What's a non-negotiable for quality versus what's adaptable?

28:15 - Lazola Makhupula
Well, there are a couple of non-negotiables. Most of them are linked to what is South African policy and law. The biggest one for me, and I'm very biased towards this because I'm also the child safeguarding officer for Smart Start, is child protection. Non-negotiable, anything that has the potential to endanger children is a non-negotiable. So we cannot be doing that. Then the second layer is about adhering to policy and guidelines across the board, whether that's us, whether that's practitioners, whether that's the coach, those things need to be there. And then there's a bit more flexibility. In certain aspects. Like for example, we are not the only organizations that provide support and programs, right? There are other organizations that provide much more intense programs than our light touch solution. So one of the flexibilities there is that marrying the two kinds of systems, depending on who you are as a practitioner is usually a good idea. To ensure that practitioners can even grow much beyond than what we currently provide. And then again, as I said, we have guidance on things like a daily routine, but it's not a Bible that you must follow. We know that that is what is helping us drive child outcomes in this system, but a daily routine doesn't have to be the Smart Start daily routine. Still be any diluting. So that's where flexibility then starts to come in is where you look at the programmatic innovation pieces rather than what is in law and what is in South African policy to adhere to.

30:18 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. The next question is in reference to franchisor relationship. You work with 16 16 franchisors who directly support practitioners. From a Platform operations perspective, what makes that relationship work? What makes it hard?

30:43 - Lazola Makhupula
What makes it hard is a very simple answer. Human beings. What makes it work is getting human beings to behave right. But also is the ability to find alignment on what the mission is across the sector with those organizations. The other piece is that diversity, as much as it can be a negative thing, in this case, it's also quite a huge positive because then people different perspectives and because of diversity, because of what the organization's diversity looks like, but also the contextual diversity from different parts of the country. What we've been building together is like regional moments of leadership where you have regional hubs at a provincial level. And what that looks like is multiple organizations being able to form one provincial structure, and this started out in the Eastern Cape, it's growing into other provinces. I think the most difficult thing there is, again, it has to do a lot with humans and maybe some that's money, is about then those organisations being able to construct a governance structure for themselves, given that they are and you are talking about two or three CEOs, strong personalities. So, you know, coming into a space like that where you need to identify a role based on your own strengths is not the easiest thing to do. So governing a regional hub is not easy. And then the other thing is that, obviously for people, time is also money. So finding time to do some of the things that are strategically important, but it's not a budget line item in the organizations is a very, very difficult balance to manage and the role that Smart Start plays. But in reality, a Platform is not a funder. So though we will help build the guardrails, we a great view from a Ford to a Porsche. Unfortunately, we can only build the route.

33:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. How has Mudslide's training approach evolved over 10 years? What have you learned about what actually works for training practitioners in low resource communities?

33:39 - Lazola Makhupula
Well, one of the biggest lessons is, and this is not smart start lesson it's a more of an industry lesson now repeated in the last thrive by five when the last two drive by five so truly but a bit more on this one is that for ECD practitioners to thrive they don't need a qualification that that's the biggest thing they don't need this intense one year two year intense training before you And that is embedded in SmartStats DNA. We have a 5D in-person training, which is, you know, against most in the industry and is not standard. But again, there isn't one piece of research that has ever linked the level of qualification to child outcomes. We just haven't been able to prove that. However, we know that there is some form of capacity development that is required and we managed to consolidate what is normally 12 24 months of training into a week in person and then other moments of training over time as and when you need them and then the support of the coaching function whether that's through a call Centre whatever else it is. For us we've seen that evolving into that is what actually drives outcomes because then you get this continuous live support as you experience some of the things that you learned in class rather than the whole, you know, university-like notion where you get trained on multiple possible scenarios around your specialty and then you have to go and figure it out in the world and you go and find your own support structure if it exists, you know, a lot of things just become dependent on the ether. And then the second piece is that most qualifications teach you about multiple possibilities on how to run ECD, whether that's a play-based mechanism or a different kind. And our DNA focus on one specific way teaching ECV, which we researched and found to be the most powerful, which is play based. And we only teach and then continuously support that mechanism. So it's very, very targeted. In the form of a practitioner, you don't have all these choices. Now that you have to then sit there as a practitioner and figure out for yourself, which kind of pedagogical approach you're going to take based on the three or five that you've learned. We just focus on one and continue to strengthen that.

36:39 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. The next section focuses on operational challenges. What breaks or becomes exponentially harder at smart start scales? What worked at a thousand practitioners that doesn't work at 15,000?

36:59 - Lazola Makhupula
Is thinking that the hub can do everything that we have learned and continue to learn. That is not going to be possible. And then thinking that when the scale of the solution grows, then we also need to scale in equal proportions the solvers is not going to fly because there's only finite resources to be able to do this. So we have to figure out new creative ways on how to manage when we scale. I think one of the biggest aspects is we have a lot of logistics support And through the stipend process, a lot of payment, and you can imagine there needs to be an audit trail there. So growing that from a hub-led, semi-automated or semi-manual process is currently excruciating, and we've really focused on strategies to be able to do that a lot better a lot more automation than we currently have, and then decentralizing some of the logistics from the hub to either those regional hubs or some of the organizations that have the capabilities closer so that we don't incur unnecessary costs like shipping things from Johannesburg. If something needs to be in Islam and it can actually be sourced field and then distribute it from East London. That's a much lower cost than us sourcing it here and then hauling it to East London. So that's one of the items. The other one is that there's a then the diversity in the tentacles of a network because of some of the things that we've held as levels of management or control, if you will, becomes very difficult. And one of the key things is to decentralize that leadership. Like a red PQA doesn't have to be my problem. It doesn't have to ring alarm bells in my head. The CEO of the organization of the franchise or the branch manager and the and their own coach, it has to ring alarm bells for them so that they solve that at that level before it even comes to me. That's the other pieces that creating the culture to do that. And I think then one of the most massive things to do now as we change quite a lot of some fundamentals is to think about quick wins on behavior change to ensure that becomes embedded in culture a lot faster than we have been doing for the past 10 years.

40:15 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. So just to add on to that previous question, what operational challenges keep you up at night? And if you could redesign one system from scratch, what would it From scratch, it would be our technology Platform.

40:39 - Lazola Makhupula
You didn't say why, so I'm going to stop there.

40:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Please elaborate.

40:51 - Lazola Makhupula
Generally speaking, how you build technologies with the future in mind, right? As far as you can see it. Or as far as we can anticipate it. Over the past 10 years, Smart Start has to build technology the other way around to solve existing pain points with a little bit of medium term solving in mind. And what that resulted in is helping a Platform with too many tool choices and that can quickly get confusing for the user and complex. It is extremely excruciating and complex for the team that has to manage it in the back end and makes it very, very difficult process to get data centralized and therefore the subsequent action of all the organization's data or in one place all at the same time, meaning that there needs to be different pushes and nudges to get us there. So although it's a good enough functional system, it can be a lot more efficient and effective and future-proof to remove some of the dependencies that we know we cannot sustain at the moment, manage tools under one Platform. So that's the big push that I would choose. And then there's a lot more of the organisation that still remains in an analogue or paper-based state that could be a lot more efficient if there were technology solutions to manage the work.

42:46 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. What's the hardest operational decision you've had to make over the past few years? Where did you have to choose between competing goods?

43:01 - Lazola Makhupula
Hardest operational decision? I mean, given that I'm still in probation, I can verify that I still am. The hardest one to make was make a decision. My team is huge. 75% of smart start is my team. And making decisions is very, very difficult for that team because the organization culture is very consultative in nature. So the hardest decision making strategy that I've had to introduce was sometimes just making a decision and then having to either live with the consequences and try it out and pivot if a pivot is required. So that decision to introduce much more centralized decision making on certain items because of the time sensitivity or strategic nature, whatever it might be, was probably one of the biggest and hardest decisions Certainly not for me, but for the team that I lead to be able to understand and buy into.

44:23 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. How did COVID-19 test Smartstart Platform operations? What broke? What surprisingly held together?

44:34 - Lazola Makhupula
I would be lying to you if I said I knew because At that time, I was in Cape Town, working for a different organization, but I can tell you what I've had, is that obviously one of the biggest things was that there would have been no coach support, right, at all in person. And at that time, Smartstart was not, was still in the process of planning how to provide hybrid support. So the pivot from in-person support to hybrid support was forced externally and the organization had to make do with what it could which is it's one of the reasons why we have the diversity that's unnecessary in technologies that we have to do quick wins than properly planned and designed technology architecture. Then the second piece is that practitioners had no children right and we had to figure out ways to be able to support parents to be the practitioners and obviously that required a bit of technology but on the side of the practitioners it required a lot of emotional support and that those two things in particular are the things that I hear about the most and then obviously it meant that an organization who was never On a full organizational level, hybrid system had to move to working hybrid like everybody else. I think that is not unique to Smart Start, but that was also a big learning curve to such an extent that when I hear when Smart Start came back to the office, there wasn't enough space for everybody. There still isn't, so we had to then consider hybrid working so that we can swap out days instead of all being at the office in the same day.

46:39 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. So the next section focuses on practitioner support reality. What does it actually take to support 15,000 practitioners, not aspirationally but realistically? What resources, systems or people does it take?

47:03 - Lazola Makhupula
It takes blood, sweat and tears, to be honest. It's not an easy job to do. Our coaches have, you know, practitioner, most, 67% of our coaches have to support more than 120 practitioners. If you can imagine that. Highest number is about 327. That's the coach with the most practitioners. They have 327 people to support. So there isn't enough days in the calendar year for that human being to be able to support all of those people to the level that they need, right? And to manage that, we've had figure out multiple strategies, which again include things like a call Centre, using WhatsApp groups, and then shared coaching in instances where, you know, a lot more people come out. And it also requires that multiple people support each other. So a Program lead or a branch manager has to support their coaches, field officers sometimes get called to support some of the coach activities because there isn't enough time. And then the other thing is that we then as a hub, the head office, always have to consider how best we can make things easier on the network up to the coach, up to the practitioner. And how do we get other people involved to support is a key thing. Then the last thing I'll say, it's just contextual, is that in the communities we work with, ECD is not really a priority because there are other, if you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, there are other needs that are more at the base than at the tip of that triangle. And one of the biggest ones is poverty, especially food poverty. But there's technology poverty, there's other forms, but food poverty is a real thing. The saving grace for us is that we've realised now a lot more often than not, than one of the biggest reasons that parents even send their kids to these practices is because in some instances it's the only meal that child can possibly get access to, is being able to school and practitioners, most of them pay out of pocket to be able to feed all these children. So we also now, in addition to training and support and stipends and all these things, have to continuously figure out how do we find people whose day job it is to provide nutrition for children and figure out how do we partner with them to close the gap on that poverty piece. It is a very, very good thing. So it is quite literally blood, sweat and tears, not to mention working in a South African government system that still shows up as more of a than a core problem solver. The government just puts regulations and all of these gateways that are absolutely impossible for some of these people to even get through. And trying to get the government to shift their mindset has been 10 years worth of work. I mean, that's the reason why we have a bronze registration, relaxed red tape, even an ECD strategy and a 10 billion rent, which is unheard of for ECD. All of those things combined, like working the system at a mezzo level and working the system at the micro level requires all of us to be in the right headspace. And yeah, I mean, that even includes Thabo. It requires him to get all of his English ready for social of the speech is right so that you can get others to see and then commit to solving this problem.

51:42 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. What support do practitioners desperately need that you can't provide at scale? It's just to add to the question that I asked.

51:57 - Lazola Makhupula
They need lots of You see, the thing is the government system starts to intervene at what I would call registration level, right? To get to registration level, there are three or four other stages you need to get to. You need to find people who are willing to become practitioners. Those people need to have a space, they need to get trained, they need to get supported, they need to have some form of startup or incubation capital to even get to registration, right? So, for one million children to be able to access the system, the government doesn't intervene in opening up access, which is those who want to three or four steps to get people to be registration ready. Because then if we invested in steps one, two, and three, then we can create a whole lot more access, especially for the children that are in the most difficult communities to reach, to be able to get there. So until such a New access, right, is seen as the biggest opportunity for the other one million children to access. We won't really solve this problem with existing e-city Centres because space is finite, construction costs are high, and Smart Start believes in starting with where you are with what you have. If you have a lounge in your room, if you have a garage, if you have a spare room, if you have a church, if you have a community hall, that's where we start. We don't say build a Centre. And the behavior in the ECD sector has always been that a Centre is a beautiful looking place. For us, this is an emergency to the point that you start where you are, as long as you have a safe, comfortable space for children within context. And I say within context specifically because if you are in Alex, you can't expect somebody to use a garage they don't have. Other people in that community are living in shacks. So an ECD centre or an ECD centre starting point looks like a shack in Alex's example. A beautifully built ECD centre that would be out of place in that context. So those kinds of support structures under the the incubation space and that the demand, creating demand and then incubating new access and embedding quality from the get-go is the absolute critical investment that's required. And by and large, it is money. There are other things that sit underneath that, but the financial resources are the biggest lever.

55:11 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. We have five more questions left. The 2023 evaluation shows strong outcomes. How much of that is Smart Starts Program design versus practitioners innovating beyond what you have taught them?

55:34 - Lazola Makhupula
It depends. If you want me to answer you with my research, head on or with my chief programming Platform officer head?

55:45 - vuledzani Tshivhase
If you could try and incorporate the two heads.

55:49 - Lazola Makhupula
Yeah, a little bit of both. Oh no, then that's completely diverging opinions. The quickest thing is that we see tracer things that we can link to the way our Program runs. One of the things is about the daily routine, so which is like a core part of the Program. Like we know and we have seen it from the evaluations that having a daily routine contributes very largely to child outcomes. So our role in standardizing that routine as a guidance principle is very critical. Then the second layer is about coaching and the continuous support. Not just somebody graduates and then they are on their own. So that coaching piece, continuous support, and having a community of support has also been shown to be a key thing. I'm just going to stick to those two things. There are many other things. But if you look at those two things, Smartstart has a role to play, a very big role. And I say a big role because we know this is what introduce, right? Now, putting my research ahead on, we can claim that all of this is because of Smart Start. Because people could literally have their own volition to come up with a daily routine. And they could create and already are creating communities of being able to support each other. So that we provide structure, tools, materials to do this and we contribute in guiding towards the gateways of success rather than creating the gateways of success themselves. So in that sense, like from a purely technical research perspective, we have a contribution that we can really be relating to that. But to say that the organisation is the only player responsible for that and that practitioners couldn't be able to do this themselves without smart strategy is simply untrue because there are other practitioners who are not supported by any NGO who do this, right? But it becomes better here because all the things are default. You don't need to go and find and create them from scratch. You don't need to learn about and then research a daily routine. You don't need to find friends or people who can support you. That is part of the infrastructure that comes with the Does that make sense?

58:33 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Yes, it does, it does. Thank you. The next section focuses on open Platform transition. Smart Start talks about transitioning from being the primary deliverer to being a Platform orchestrator. From your operational seat, what does that actually mean? What has to change?

58:58 - Lazola Makhupula
What has to change is the, well, there's multiple levels to it, right? And is that an open Platform means it's open to other forms of partnering with people. So right now we use, our system is a closed source, well, a semi-open source, let me put it the other way around. And I say that because it's a franchise model. So what that means is that you need to have a franchise agreement with us. To be able to be part of the Platform full Platform. And and run the the model that we've come up with as a as an organization and then defined as a network. Now an open Platform means we need to think about different ways and be open to different ways of partnering or doing with others. An example that I can give is if an organization would still like to use the Smartstart model or plug-in to the support of Smartstart, but they don't want to become a franchisor, meaning they don't want to use the Smartstart brand necessarily. Then we have to think about how we can do that, right? And that's part of opening the system to others without necessarily sacrificing quality at scale. And then the second piece to look into there is that there are pieces of the model that we know that we can unbundle and people can use as open or digital or public needs, let me not say digital, because some things are not digital. But it's open source public goods to be able to utilize. And that obviously requires that we unbundle the things that are not necessarily risky then to utilize in a space like that. We can easily unbundle, right, and that That could be things like curriculum or technology or the likes. Then the other piece that then exists there is then thinking about if you move from the franchise model to an open model, then what are the other contracting mechanisms? Because, and I say contracting because there still needs to level of guardrails. Child protection is one of them, having quality assurance systems is one of them, as an example, right? So if there's still some guardrails, it means there's still levels of terms and conditions. So how do you have a sort of click to accept T&Cs kind of system, rather than a, this is a franchise Zinc agreement and you are going to do X, Y, Z because you have to. These are the terms and conditions in the form of bad laws and you have to be at least within these bounds to partner with us type of system. So that's the other thing. And then the last thing for us to really, really consider is that then that becomes multiple delivery models or multiple pathways of deliveries that we have to consider because of all this extra diversity that we potentially introduce into the system. And that looks like for relegating our role in the ecosystem to the guardrail level rather than Thank you for that.

1:03:11 - vuledzani Tshivhase
I think you've also managed to answer my next question. But you said you would unbundle and maybe share the curriculum and whatnot. But I wanted to know, what would you keep? You could give them curriculum, training or coaching, but what would you keep? What would you keep to yourself?

1:03:41 - Lazola Makhupula
The problem we are solving is a moving target because there's always context that comes in at every point. And that context is a real-time problem, like it's not It's not something that you can solve once and then be done with it, right? So the innovation aspect needs to remain there for us to be able to thrive. Then the reality out there is that the people who are going to work and co-solve with us, either organizations or individual practitioners. So we need to be able to make sure that we can hold the fort, even if the people that have been doing some of the work have gone, so that when others come in to fill that space, then they they are able to get the same kind of support so that they can hold the space. So it is important again for us to maintain our role in ecosystem orchestration as well as consideration of a national level delivery Platform rather than to focus on either a specific province or a specific local Exactly, precisely for that reason that people come and go within the sector. And we need to make sure that children continue to have access, whether or not it's the same people.

1:05:37 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Thank you for that. The next question, I also feel like you have touched on quite a bit. From a pure operations perspective, what needs to happen to reach one million children while maintaining quality? What are the operational constraints, but maybe let's focus on if you had to choose one million children with 80% quality or 500,000 90% quality, which one would you choose? One million with 80% quality.

1:06:15 - Lazola Makhupula
We care about quantity and quantity is really like one of our most important things. But one of the other things that exist is that the biggest problem right now that South Africa faces is access. Like we know that in the cohort of children that are already accessing the system, last statistics show that about three out of 10 of them access a quality system, right? But obviously that's the minority still of children. So ours is not to try and get children into the system and then build quality. It's to get children in the system with good enough quality, right? So I would rather have a situation that 100% of all children get into the system, but 8 out of 10 accessing a quality Program than to have children 50% and 9 out of 10 accessing a quality Program, because the most excluded then continue to be excluded even more if they are not in the system. If I were to choose between quality and access, choose access all day every day because it would rather know them in the system and what level of quality they are at to build that app than have them out of the system where we don't even know where quality sits. Does it make sense? You need.

1:08:06 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Sorry, sorry. We have, it does make sense. And now we have two questions left. And they just focus on like reflections. When you look back over your time at Smart Start, what operational achievement makes you most proud? What did you build that you didn't think was possible? And maybe also just touch on what you've learned about operating its scheme?

1:08:39 - Lazola Makhupula
One of those that I didn't think was possible is a team. So when I came here I inherited by and large a team that used to report to two other chiefs and building those human beings into one team has been one of the most to try and do because, and the reason why this for me is a win that was important is because everything else is downstream from getting that right. It is not 100% there yet, but it's a lot more than what it has been before. And that is important because to get this team to think about quality and to own what is core business, for Smart Start, which is our Program and the Platform itself, then you need to make sure that you have organization geared towards supporting that. And anything on top of that is icing on the cake, right? So it was important for me at an organizational level to ensure that that 75% of the organization is functioning as a best coordinated machine as it possibly can, given the time that I've been here. Then the second thing, and the most fundamental thing for me about scale is that it is important to understand the concept of scale versus growth. And that's exactly what you spent the last two and a half days with the network discussing in Benoni, but the most important thing is not about understanding that per se. It is a lot more about understanding how we drive behaviour change that's geared towards the end. And that is the piece that will either make or break the organisation. So we are in a long haul process of behavioural change. And that is the one key I look for in everybody, for the understanding and then behaving it still.

Thank you so much for that. Your operational perspective is essential to understanding how Smart Start actually works at scale. Is there anything else that maybe we didn't ask that you'd like to speak to, or are you satisfied with everything that you've provided?

I don't know about satisfied, but I feel like I've said enough.

1:11:47 - vuledzani Tshivhase
Okay, thank you so much for making the time. Thank you.

1:11:51 - Lazola Makhupula
