Anne-Marie Coaches Little Seeds	

SmartStart 10-Year Report Interview: Coach Perspectives (Anne-Marie)
1. Role
"Tell me about your role at SmartStart. What do you do day-to-day?"
Response
I work as a SmartStart coach. Day-to-day, I support SmartStarters (practitioners) to make sure they are able to implement the programme properly and deliver it effectively. I also work alongside stakeholders and partners, because part of my role is building relationships with key partners in my area.

2. Journey
"How did you come to work for SmartStart? What attracted you to this work?"
Response
I didn’t plan it in a straight line—I just knew I had a passion for community development. I was working in retail, but I wanted to do something meaningful in my community. I started volunteering, and over time I found myself working with community leaders who were talking about early learning and SmartStart.
Eventually, I was told SmartStart needed a coach and I was flown to Johannesburg, and that’s how it started. I began working through a partnership with the church and an organisation called Little Seeds. Little Seeds is linked to the Dutch Reformed Church (Inklet), and they work with churches across the Western Cape. In Mossel Bay, the church saw a big gap in early learning and decided to endorse and take up the SmartStart project in that area. I have been working in this role since 2016.

3. Practitioner support
"Describe a typical interaction with a practitioner you're coaching. What do you work on together?"
Response
Most of my support is centred on the programme itself. I work with practitioners to make sure they feel supported to deliver the programme well, that it runs smoothly, and that it is effective for children. It’s not only about one thing, but the majority of the coaching is about helping them implement the programme properly and consistently.

4. Transformation stories
"Can you share a story of a practitioner you've coached who really transformed their practice? What changed?"
Response
I think of one practitioner who was trained in 2017 and faced many challenges. At first, she didn’t have a site, and then she didn’t have children enrolled—it went on like that for quite a while. There were also two sisters trained around the same time: one started in her backyard under very difficult conditions, and the other struggled even more because she didn’t have a site.
I kept visiting, supporting, and helping them figure out what steps they could take to get started. I also helped with referrals—for example, speaking about her at ECDs. While she didn’t have children, she began volunteering at ECDs. After a year or two, she joined her sister and they worked together in an informal structure.
Later, when her parents passed away, she inherited their home and was able to transform it into a centre. For me, it’s a success story because she never lost her passion to work with children despite the barriers. I walked the journey with her through all those stages until she found her footing—around 2019, if I remember correctly. Today, she runs a successful centre with over 50 children and three classrooms, and her business is profitable.

5. Franchisor relationship
"How do you work with franchisors? What's that relationship like?"
Response 
In my context, Little Seeds provides support to coaches—things like resources and logistics. But because their office is in Cape Town and I’m based in Mossel Bay, they can’t always be present in my area as often as they would like.
Over the years, the church has been my biggest support structure locally. If there is a meeting or an event where organisational representation is needed, the church often stands in and supports those processes. My manager at Little Seeds is supportive and assists as much as she can, and Little Seeds also supports us with SmartStart resources.

6. Quality challenges
"What are the biggest quality challenges you see in early learning practice? How do you address them?"
Response 
A major quality challenge is limited resources. The resources practitioners receive help, but they are not enough, and it affects the quality of stimulation—especially when there aren’t enough toys and materials. Another challenge is that the physical environment and infrastructure are not always as nurturing as they should be.
We try to address this by partnering with like-minded organisations that can potentially unlock additional resources or funding. The church has played a big role over the years in helping improve sites—whether through toys, equipment, or whatever support is possible. We also encourage practitioners to be innovative and make toys from recycled materials, but I don’t feel that it fully solves the gap.
I also recognise that practitioners are micro-enterprises and shouldn’t rely only on what SmartStart provides, but because we are working in very poor communities, it remains a real challenge.

7. Training evolution
"How has SmartStart's training approach changed over the years? What have you learned about what works?"
Response
The biggest improvement that stands out for me is the business skills training. Many practitioners have passion and can implement the programme, but they struggle with the business side—how to sustain their centre and manage it properly. Strengthening business skills has been important.
I’ve also learned that the timing of business training matters. I wish it could come much earlier—closer to the five-day start-up training, or soon after—because practitioners may learn how to work with children, but without business skills they struggle to sustain themselves and may leave the programme.

8. Platform role
"SmartStart calls itself a 'platform.' From your perspective, what does that mean? How do you see yourself as part of the platform?"
Response 
To me, SmartStart as a platform is about giving women an opportunity—especially women who may have little to no formal skills—to grow into early learning work and build something in their communities.
I see myself as part of the platform because I am based in the community. I advocate for early learning and I am a key connection point between SmartStart and practitioners—helping open the door for women to access the opportunity and supporting them to succeed.

9. Barriers
"What makes your job hard? What gets in the way of supporting practitioners effectively?"
Response 
It has improved over time, but earlier on my job was difficult because I was working in isolation. For a long time, I had only the church for support on the ground, while the organisational office was far away, and I felt like the only voice for SmartStart in the community.
It was also hard because we were not initially working alongside other key role players. That created competition and mistrust, and people didn’t believe in SmartStart as a brand. Community entry wasn’t done properly in the beginning, and that made things difficult—especially around trust and retention. Over the last five years, things have improved.

10. Impact
"When you see the impact of your coaching, what does that look like? How do you know it's working?"
Response 
I know my coaching is working when I see practitioners applying what we’ve worked on in practice.
One example: a couple of years ago, practitioners started raising concerns about children struggling emotionally—having difficulty settling in and interacting with others. We decided to run a coaching circle and reviewed our programme activities and themes. Together, we decided to start the year with a theme focused on emotions, because children at that age often lack emotional and social skills. It helped, and what was meaningful for me was seeing that practitioners continued using that approach and carried it forward because it was effective.

11. Pride
"What are you most proud of in your work with SmartStart?"
Response 
I’m most proud that SmartStart has given me a platform to make a change in my community. I’m proud that I can be a change agent, and that I’ve been given the opportunity to contribute to early learning in a meaningful way where I live.

12. Future
"What do you hope for SmartStart's training and coaching system over the next decade?"
Response 
I hope the five-day start-up training can be longer. Many women enter the programme with passion but very little knowledge or experience in early learning. For those with an ECD background, the training may feel fast and manageable, but for those starting from scratch, five days is not enough for them to be fully ready to implement effectively. A longer training would help them build stronger foundations.

Additional questions
13. Feedback loops
"How does feedback from SmartStarters influence the training or coaching you provide? Can you give an example of something that changed because of practitioner feedback?"
Response 
Feedback from practitioners is very important and often eye-opening. Being in the field, you’re always learning from what practitioners share, and I appreciate that SmartStart is open to adapting. I couldn’t think of a clear example on the spot, but I said I would share one later if it came to mind.
One practical example I did mention earlier is how practitioner concerns about children’s emotional and social needs led us to adjust our coaching focus and start the year with an emotions theme.

14. Scale enablers
"What makes it possible for SmartStart to support 15,000 practitioners? What would break if you tried to double that number?"
Response 
What makes it possible is the network model and the ecosystem approach—bringing in more like-minded organisations and partners to support the work. That model helps SmartStart reach many women and children across the country.
If we tried to double the number without strengthening support systems, we would struggle—especially with maintaining quality. If we don’t continue building and deepening the ecosystem approach and support structures, then scaling up would become very difficult and quality would drop.

15. Innovation from practitioners
"Can you share an example of a SmartStarter who innovated something in their practice that you then shared with other practitioners?"
Response
One innovation that stood out to me was a practitioner who was very strong on parent involvement. She created events that drew parents into the programme—things like storytelling, engagement events, and graduation events.
What really impressed me was how she linked parent involvement to sustainability. For example, she held a graduation event at a venue, and because she had already hired the venue, she used it again afterward for a second community event where people paid entry at the door. In that way, she ran two events in one and raised funds to support her daycare. She even hosted a children’s “ball” as part of this, and parents were involved in raising funds. I saw it as a smart and innovative approach, and it’s something other practitioners can learn from.

12:23 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.
12:24 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. Um, so tell me about your role at smart start. What do you do? Okay.
12:31 - Sonia Mabena
So, from last Year, March, as I mentioned earlier, I became, I was promoted to a program lead. So, what I do is we have club coaches, right, who are responsible for guiding the franchises that we have on the ground and supporting them. So, my role as a program lead is to support those club coaches. I don't want to say manage, but I support them. I supervise their work just to make sure that they are coping on site. And then I also do a lot of admin work, which includes reporting, attending meetings, and all of that. So yeah, that's what I do on a day-to-day. I'm not required to go on site. My job is mainly at the office, but I do go on site sometimes just what the coaches are getting up to, if they are coping. And sometimes when they need my assistance with maybe quality assurance and all of that, then I also do that, yeah.
13:47 - vule Tshvhs
And how did you come to work for Smart Start? What attracted you to this work?
13:56 - Sonia Mabena
So, I think I saw a post in 2019 saying that they needed a club Coach in the free state, right? So, they did write that it's for, I'll be a club Coach for early learning development. So, I've always been into that because I studied psychology initially. So, I wanted to work with children, but as a psychologist, but then when I couldn't find a job and all of that, then I was like, okay, let me just try this out. Because it's still in the early childhood sector, I'll still be making a difference in the children's lives. Then I applied, then I was called, then I moved to the Free State, where I started working with the franchises that were running the program that side.
14:48 - vule Tshvhs
And then the next question. Describe a typical interaction with practitioner you're coaching, what do you work on together?
15:02 - Sonia Mabena
So, okay. So, it'll be a lot of, um, I'll be referencing to the time I was still a Coach. Remember now I'm no longer a Coach. Yeah. Yeah. So, my typical day or interaction with a, with a practitioner would be, it would depend on what we So sometimes I would go quality assure them we have what we call a PQA. Is what we call program quality assurance. If a practitioner trained with us, then after three months I need to go and check if they are running the program the correct way and all of that. So, I would then go and just be there with them whilst they are running our daily routine. And then after they've run the daily routine, then I would give them feedback, obviously, on how they did. And then during that whole interaction, they also tell me about any challenges that they might be having on site with the children and how everything is going. Then, yeah, that's how typically I would. So, as a club Coach, you're not just there to see if they're doing their work. No, you also to support them with whatever challenges they might be facing, whether it's personal, whether it's with the children, whether it's with space, nutrition, whatever they need support with, then you need to support them. But most of the time, because the franchises, the practitioners, practitioners, franchises, the time I was a club Coach, I had, I think, 160 franchises that I was supporting. So, most of the time, my interaction with them would be via phone calls, or WhatsApp because I couldn't drive to all of them on a daily basis. So, when I would call them just to check how they are doing, how is the program going, do they need any support, do they need any forms, child registration forms from me or whatever, then they would then say. So, yeah, that's typically how our interaction would go, yeah.
17:05 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. So, just to reflect back on the practitioner and what you did in your previous role, can you share a story of a practitioner you've coached who really transformed their practice?
17:19 - Sonia Mabena
So, there's a practitioner that trained with me I think in 2021, yes in 2021. So, she started out as a what we call a day mother. She had six, I think six, seven children at that time when she trained. Then after her training, I went to check her space. After checking her space, obviously, then I just to check if there's children there, then I gave her our start-up kit, we call it a start-up kit. Then after that, I continued supporting her throughout all her daily training activities. And then in, I think, a space of Her center grew whereby now she was able to employ other teachers, because I think before I left the club coaching position, she had about, she had employed about five, yeah, five or six teachers that were working under her. So now she was a principal. So, remember, she started as a day mother. Now she grew to being a principal. And a principal who's now employing other people. She opened employment opportunities for other ladies as well, who also trained and joined this master program. So, her story is a success story because she started as a gay mother, but she was able to grow her center to a point whereby she's now registered with the government. She's under the Department of Basic Education. She also received her goal registration and is receiving funding from the government so yeah.
19:06 - vule Tshvhs
Okay that's good. Okay and then on the franchisor relationship, how do you work with franchisors? What's the relationship like,
19:18 - Sonia Mabena
So, you mean okay so okay and let me just make sure if I understand it. So, you mean actually I work for a franchisor called Lima right? Yes. So how do I work with Lima or?
19:31 - vule Tshvhs
Yes. And what's that relationship like,
19:35 - Sonia Mabena
Um, so our relationship is good because I mean, as much as I'm working under the program, right. My employer is still Lima, the franchisor. Right. So yes, we are implementing and running the Smith program on the ground. But, um, Most of the things that we do, we need to follow Lima's rules and regulations and all of that. So, I would say the relationship is working. It's working because most of the things we do really, we are guided by Lima. But when we are on site, then there needs to be that differentiation that, okay, now I'm on site. These franchisees belong to Smart Start. But as Sonia, I am employed by Lima, you understand what I'm saying? So at first it can get a bit confusing because at first you're confused as to, okay, who do I listen to? Who do I Report to and all of that. But now there's a clear differentiation because we do have our managers and everyone from Lima's side. We also have our managers and relationship managers and all of that from Smart Start's side. So we are reporting to all those managers who also get together at some point and reports and all of that. So I think that's where the connection happens when they get together and discuss how we did, our targets and stuff. So I think, yeah, so far the relationship is working for me so far, even though at first it was confusing because it's as if you're working for two organizations basically.
21:13 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. And what are the biggest quality challenges you see in early learning practice? How do you address that?
21:26 - Sonia Mabena
So, okay, so I think when we train franchises, the practitioners, some of them come with the idea that, okay, so obviously there's two groups of people. There's people who are really in this business for giving children quality early learning, right? Then there's groups of people that I've come across who are just doing this because of the money or maybe they are not working or whatever, whatever the case may be. So you find that along the way, after their training, then they would, such people will compromise quality whereby we do, after the training, we do tell them that there's gonna be coaches who are gonna come and just check up on you and check if you are really implementing the program, and you are implementing it in a way that is correct, and your site is safe for the children and all of that. And our coaches do that, yes. But then along the line, you'll see that some of the practitioners just lose the momentum and the love for the program, especially we have, so we have a subsidy, right? So the subsidy is just for two years. After the subsidy is gone, then you the center and find that a franchisee practitioner is no longer implementing the program, the Smart Start program. So that's when you see that the person was just in it for the money and not for the love of children. So as a Coach, you are faced with the difficult decision to withdraw, revoke that practitioner's license because they're no longer running the program and it's some of their sites, you find that they're no longer safe for the children. So you need to take their licenses away and also take the starter kit that I mentioned before. You also need to take that away as well so that you can give that to other French practitioners that are still running the program. And that does cause a bit of tension on the ground, but yeah, that's how we, That's the strategy we use so far to deal with such cases of people that are compromising quality on the ground.
23:48 - vule Tshvhs
And how has that training approach changed over the years? What have you learned about what works?
23:59 - Sonia Mabena
I think the training approach, so when I got here in 2019, We were just training anyone and everyone, right? Whether it's your principal, teacher, assistant, whatever, we're just training anyone and everyone. But then along the years, specifically the five days training, our startup training has really grown and developed in a way that we now have different trainings So when I got here, for example, I'll make an example with our start-up training session. It's a five-day start-up training session. So back then, everyone would train for that five days, right? But now, if you are a principal who's owning a center, then you are the one that's going to train for the five days. If you are a teacher employed by a principal, you're no longer attending the full five days, you're just attending the four days, because the Friday of our training is where they discuss the business aspect of ECD centres. And as a teacher, I don't really need to be chewed up about business and all of that. So the reason why they changed that is because back then when they were training everyone for the five days, And everyone was trained on the business aspect of things. A lot of teachers left their ECD centers and wanted to open their own centers after the training. So that caused a whole lot of trouble between the coaches and the principals on the ground. So I think that after that change, we saw that the principals on the ground also appreciate the fact that SMART Start listened to them and are no longer training the teachers, they are teachers for the business side of things. The business side of things is only left to a business owner who is the principal. So I think that I appreciate that change that happened because now we're no longer fighting with principals on the ground. And then there's also the assistance training now because an assistant does not really need the full five days training. An assistant does not have a classroom. So an assistant just assists the teacher the classroom, they don't need to be trained on the full five days. So yeah, those changes are changes that I really appreciate a lot because as much as they include everyone, if no one feels left out, they include everyone. But then now we've eliminated those fights that were happening on the ground after the five days training. Yeah. OK.
26:53 - vule Tshvhs
A smart start calls itself a platform. From your perspective, what does that mean? And how do you see yourself as part of the platform?
27:06 - Sonia Mabena
So from my perspective, I think, so I think why it calls itself a platform is that just as the Just as the slogan says, that it gives every child the power to succeed, right? We need to remember why it was formed in the first place, why the program was started in the first place. It was started to give every child the power to succeed, whether the child comes from a disadvantaged background or an advantaged background, whatever, but every child deserves quality early learning. So I think that's why Smart Start is a platform for all the children to receive quality early learning. Also, it is a platform for both women and men that are not working, that are not employed, to be employed, to self-sustain themselves, to start their own businesses. Because it also, as much as gives children the quality early learning, but it also creates business opportunities for those men and women that want to change these children's lives. So I think I'm a part of that platform because as a Coach, I was going on the ground, sourcing those men and women that wanna give these children and quality early learning. So after the training, those men and women change these children's lives. So I think that's how it is a platform, and that's how I am a part of that platform, yeah.
28:59 - vule Tshvhs
OK. Thank you for that. OK, let's reflect on the barriers. What makes your job hard? What gets in the way of supporting So I'll just give you an example of myself.
29:20 - Sonia Mabena
So I think what made the job hard, because I was coming from, I was coming from free state. The time I came back from free state, then I was told that I'm going to be going to Soshanguve, right? Soshanguve is known to be a very, you know, rough place. So, number one, the safety aspect of things, you need to be, I'm traveling alone, I'm a female, you need to recruit. Can I just close this door? Sorry. Because, well, I can't hear myself. OK, sorry about that. So I think the safety aspect of everything, you are a lady traveling alone in the car. You have to go. So how we recruit, it was via word of mouth, right? So I would get lists from people. Saying, okay, these are the people that I know that are interested in starting the program, running the program. Then I need to go and verify if those people indeed have signs, indeed have children and all of that. So I was doing that all alone. So sometimes I would feel scared because I know Buti is a rough place and all of that. So number two, the distances that we need to You are given a site, a very big site. You're working alone. No one is assisting you in the site. So you need to drive from point A to B to Z all alone. So I think the distance was also a very big challenge. And then number three, I think the time, just dividing all the tasks that you need to do as a Coach, there's a whole lot that you need to do because you need to support these already existing franchisees, practitioners that you have, whilst recruiting new practitioners that need to join the program, whilst doing all of your admin. And yeah, there's just a lot that you do as a Coach. So just finding time to do all of that was also a challenge. And I think number four, just working with people on its own is a challenge because you deal with different characters, you meet different people on a daily basis. Some of them are harsh to you. Some of them have their own personal problems. So you end up becoming a social worker, if I would put it that way, when you're on the ground, more than just a top Coach, because you need to listen to their problems, help them solve their problems. Some of them are personal. So I think for me, when I was a Coach, those were the challenges was facing me on the ground.
32:28 - vule Tshvhs
That's a good reflection. And on impact, when you see the impact of your coaching, what is that like, How do you know it's working?
32:46 - Sonia Mabena
So when I see the impact of my coaching, like the story I gave to Such practitioners who are in this program for the love of children and who join our program, some of them join without any children. The person will just come and say, I heard about the program. I am interested in joining the program. How do I start? The person is just starting out. Then they start with two, three, four children. And then now they are after the after a few years they grow. Then you go to their centers. Now they have 50, 60 children. They are even registered with the government. They are receiving funding. They've also employed people under them. So they created a business for themselves that is changing the lives of these children. But they're also changing the lives of the people that they've employed. They're making a difference in their lives. So when you see that impact on the ground, you can really sit down and reflect and say, I am indeed working for a bigger cause. Because before you joined Smart Start, you'd hear that, oh, there's Smart Start. But you wouldn't really understand what it is about. But once you join the program, you work for the program, and see the thousands of women and men that grow from just sitting at home to now having businesses up and running ECD centres that are big and they employ people. I think that impact on its own is something else.
34:29 - vule Tshvhs
Yeah. Okay, then our next question. What are you most proud of in your work with Small Start?
34:41 - Sonia Mabena
So, I'm most proud of, I think when I started with Lima, so I work for a franchise called Lima. When I started with Lima, I think we had less than 500 practitioners under Lima. But now, and I think 1,000 something children that were registered under us for this master program. But now we are working towards 1,003 practitioners that are running the Smarter Program in Swane, because we're working in Swane. So, and the children that we are impacting, that we are reaching with this program in Swane alone is about 13,000 children. So, I'm proud of the growth more than anything. I'm really proud of the growth, because when we started, when we joined the Smarter Program as a franchisor, we started with a very small number of franchisors. But now we've grown to 1,003 franchises. And even the children, the number has grown, which is like 13,000 now. So yes, the number might seem small to someone who's outside of the program, but when you're inside of the program and realizing that, oh, we're actually making a difference in 13,000 children's lives. And that is just our franchisor. And we have all these other franchisors nationwide, then all of that collectively, that's what makes me proud as a Coach, yeah.
36:14 - vule Tshvhs
That's good. And looking to the future, what do you hope for Smart Starts training and coaching system over the next decade?
36:25 - Sonia Mabena
Please repeat that, I missed the second part.
36:30 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, what do you hope for Smart Starts training and coaching system over the next decade? OK.
36:39 - Sonia Mabena
So over the next decade, I think for now, we are almost doing everything right. But obviously, there's a few glitches here and there. I would just like for the coaches, because now I'm no longer a Coach, so it's a bit difficult for me to answer that. But for the coaches' challenges to be heard, I don't know how to put this. Because remember, we are franchisors, as I mentioned, right? So one franchisor is doing this. The other one is doing this. But we're all implementing this master program. So for the future, I just hope we will all be unified. Yeah, can I get personnel? Just for you to understand what I mean. Yeah. So for example, a Coach in Gauteng should earn the same salary as a Coach in the Western Cape. Do you get what I'm saying? So I wish for that, because right now, what Smarter is saying is that they can't do that, because that's up to a franchisor and all of that So my wish, yeah, what's on my wish list for the next or 10 20 years is that I just need everything to be unified. I'm hoping, I'm wishing for everything to be unified, whether it's salaries, whether it's what, everything to be the same, because I think the impact is the same. We are doing the same work, so nothing should really be different, right? So that's my wish number one. Um, for them to hire, to get more assistance for, for the coaches, because the workload of the coaches is quite a lot. It's a whole lot of things that they do. So I just wish they can get assistance if there, if there can be a budget for that. Um, just get assistance for each and every Coach. Um, if that will ever be possible, I don't know, because they do a whole lot on the ground and they also need to do admin and all of those things. And then for training, so far I think the training aspect of things is going well for me. I was just concerned about a few changes, so they've already made those changes as I mentioned, so I'm happy with that, I'm really happy with that. I just wish the training though could for a few more days because I feel like our curriculum is a whole lot of things to grasp in just five days. I think that's why when the practitioners get to the field, some of the things they forget them, some of the things they don't implement them the way they should be doing. Because I feel like five days is just too little for them to grasp everything. And yeah, the modules are hectic. So I just wish for more people days when it comes to the startup training, more days when it comes to our child progress training. Because we have a training called child progress training, whereby the practitioners train just for one day. And that training is difficult for me myself as a Coach. For me to understand some of the things is quite, it took me a long time to understand how to track the progress of children and all of that. So I wish that training had a few more maybe two days added to the one day that they are doing now, then I think the petitioners would be able to implement what they learned more efficiently.
40:35 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, so we have three more remaining questions. How does feedback from smart starters influence the training or coaching you provide, can you give an example of something that changed because of the practitioners' feedback?
41:00 - Sonia Mabena
I think for us, what we changed as an organization. So I think, remember, I did mention that we used to train teachers. Teachers that are employed by principals. And then those teachers would come to attend the start-up training for five days. Then after they've attended the start-up training, then they would just go back to the principal and say, I'm resigning. I'm going to start my own center, whatever. And the principal would be shocked and say, how, why are you doing that? So we always got feedback and complaints about that. So as an organization, we decided to implement a strategy whereby we Before when we recruit we go to the if a person is saying I am Sonia I was sent by my principal to come and train with you guys, then I would personally go as a Coach and ask that principal if they agreed to that and the Then even though they say they are fine with that, before we train their teachers, we have what we call a principal's induction. So every time before, when we recruit, every time when we recruit, if we have a long list of teachers that are coming from ECD centers, then we request what we call a principal's induction from Smartstart prior to the startup training so that those principals are inducted for a day to understand what the program is about, what is required of them, and what is required of their teachers when they join the program. So we found that our relationship with the principals has improved ever since we've implemented that, because back then we would just train the teachers without inducting their principals. Then we would find out Um, with the, with the principles. So yeah, I think that is what has changed. Yeah.
43:14 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. And our second to last question, what makes it possible for smart start to support 15,000 practitioners? What would break if you tried to double that number?
43:31 - Sonia Mabena
You broke up, you lost your bed.
43:34 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, what makes it possible for Smart Start to support 15,000 practitioners? What would break if you tried to double that number?
43:45 - Sonia Mabena
I think what makes it possible for Smart Start to support those 15,000 franchises is the coaches. It's the coaches more than anything. I remember when I came into Smart In think 2019, there was less than 50 coaches, but now I think there's 100 and something coaches that are scattered everywhere across the nation. So I think the coaches are the backbone of everything, right? And then number two, the resources that Smarter provides to them, because some of the franchisors, like our franchisor, we have come company cars that are provided to us to be able to cover all these distances that we need to cover. Then if a person, other franchisors that I know that don't have company cars, give them transport allowance and all of that. So I think the resources that SMARTSTAT provides to us as well makes all of this possible. And I think the trainers as well, the trainers that come to train these practitioners are the ones that contributed to the number because a huge part of our work, whether a practitioner stays or goes, is dependent on the training that they receive. And so that training is provided by the trainers. So I think the trainers also make, made all of this possible. And what would, you said, what would break, right? If they double the number. Yes. Hmm. I think what we think is that already we are sitting with coaches. For example, I have a Coach who has, I think, about 280 practitioners under her. She's required to support all of those 280 practitioners on her own. Already, sometimes we kind of feel like we will end up compromising quality. The more we scaling up, scaling up, quality along the way is compromised. Because I feel like the time we just had a few franchises, a Coach was able to support all of the franchises, whether it's via site visits, quality assurance, and all of that, because the number was small. But now, if I have 200 and something practitioners under me, I'm unable to make time to see all of them, to support all of them, to call all of them, do you understand? And still be required to arrange all these trainings, recruit, do this, do that. So I think the more we scale, we're scaling up, as I mentioned earlier, that if maybe every Coach can get maybe an assistant, if budget would allow, of course, Because if already we have a Coach that's sitting with 230 practitioners under her name, if you're scaling up, that means by the end of that 10 years, she'll be on 600 something practitioners under her name. And that just seems very impossible. So I think the quality more than anything, if they're not given any form of assistance, would break, yeah.
47:17 - vule Tshvhs
OK. And our last question, can you show an example of a smart starter who innovated something in their practice that you then shared with other practitioners?
47:34 - Sonia Mabena
Yes. Can it be a club? Because they have what we call clubs that they belong to, right?
47:40 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes. OK.
47:43 - Sonia Mabena
So I had a club. So, remember their stipend is just 500 rands. So, that club was like, okay, our stipend is not enough, 500 rands is not enough, because we work in communities whereby most of the parents can't afford to pay school fees. So, with the 500 rands, you have to buy them food, buy the children food, like with the 500 rands. And then it just doesn't work. So that club came up with a stock fell. So they don't give each other money in the stock fell. So what they do is they write down all of their needs, whether you need them to paint the center for you, whether your needs are nutrition-based and all of that. So they meet on a monthly basis, then they put aside some money in a savings account. Then at the end of the Year, if your need was for them to paint the center for you, then they paint the center for you. Then if you wanted them to buy you food or whatever, they do that. So it's a stockpile, but they don't give each other money every month. They save the money, and then towards the end of the Year, November, December, then that money goes to one center. This Year, we're doing this for this one center. The following Year, we're doing this for this one center. I saw that that worked for them. They were able to improve their centers. Then I introduced that strategy to the other clubs. And yeah, fortunately, some of the clubs adopted that strategy and were able to also improve their centers using that strategy. So yeah.
49:32 - vule Tshvhs
That's good. Thank you so much. Sonia for making the time. Your voice helps us show how the Smart Start platform actually works on the ground. And can we use your name if we are to quote a Coach? Say Sonia. And if you do have a photo, maybe like a professional looking photo that you would like to include for us to include in the Report, you're more than welcome to email it to me on the email address that's into the link, but that's if it's possible, if something that you can do.
50:09 - Sonia Mabena
It's not a problem. I will, yeah, I'll look for a photo then. Yeah. I will email it. I will send it.
50:15 - Unidentified Speaker
Thank you so much, Sonia.
50:17 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you so much.



Smartstart 10-Year Report Coach Interview
Coach : Sibusiso Mbele
Thu, Feb 5, 2026

4:12 - vule Tshvhs
Hello, good afternoon.

4:15 - Unidentified Speaker
Good afternoon.

4:16 - vule Tshvhs
How are you doing this afternoon?

4:20 - Sibusiso Mbele
I'm doing great, and you?

4:22 - Sibusiso Mbele
I'm good.

4:26 - vule Tshvhs
My name is Vuledzani.

4:30 - Unidentified Speaker
Vuledzani.

4:32 - vule Tshvhs
Yes, very good. My name is Vuledzani, and I know your name is Sibusiso.

4:44 - Sibusiso Mbele
That's me, and you got it right.

4:47 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. I am working with a company called Auxeira to And we want to hear your experience, what you do, how you've seen the network grow, and what you've learned. So your insight matters for the Report purposes that we are currently busy with. So please feel free to share as much as you can. The questions are not complicated. It's just drawing back from your history. And your experience. And I wanted to let you know that I am going to be recording this session for the purpose of Report writing and for record keeping, if that is OK with you.

5:47 - Unidentified Speaker
No problem.

5:49 - vule Tshvhs
OK, then I think we can start. It's just simple questions. Remember, it's within the hour, so it needs to be specific and concise. OK, so the first question is, tell me about your role at Smart Start. What do you do on a day to day?

6:17 - Sibusiso Mbele
OK, my name is Sibusiso Mbele. I am a Coach. In the area of KZN with the franchisor, let's see. My role as a Coach on a day-to-day basis is just to ensure that the franchises that we recruited, we trained, and they are implementing the program are being supported right, and they are doing the things right. There's a lot of things in my blade as a Coach. But it's not a complaint. It's just to see that everything is done accordingly. Because the Smart Starters, as they are part of the network, and they are growing the network, they are just there to ensure that the values are preserved. And then everything that is expected from the Smart Start part is being implemented to benefit the children, who are the first priority for So first things first, we recruit the potential trainees, and then we introduce them to Smart Start. And then we explain what is expected from them.

7:33 - vule Tshvhs
I think we are going to get to that question. I just wanted to understand what you do on a day. On a day-to-day basis. But my next question is, how did you come to work for Smartstart and what attracted you to this work?

8:03 - Sibusiso Mbele
I came to Smartstart a long time ago. I came across with Smartstart I'm still there. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Okay. I came across it. I don't know.

8:32 - Unidentified Speaker
I can hear you.

8:34 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, okay.

8:36 - Sibusiso Mbele
If you turn off your camera, we're going to have Stable connection, okay Okay, you can go on yeah, it sounds better now Okay, I came across it's much tight 2018 I was in Johannesburg back then and then my partner life partner Became a smart starter and then she went from Johannesburg to Kenya there to implement the program. And then down the line, I became a Smartstart, too. And then when we're implementing our program, it was just running very smooth. It was coming right in the area. And then we came across with the Let's See. The coaches were just supporting our network in the area. And then that is where I get to know Let's See connected to Smartstart. And then I was employed by, let's say, to say, observing at what I was doing, where I was, and then how would I feel if I just joined Smartstart, and then I followed the procedures, and then I gone for Interview, then I made it, then I started working as a Coach. That is how I came to be a Coach with Smartstart, yes.

9:57 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, thank you for that. And describe a typical interaction with a practitioner you are coaching, what do you work on together?

10:12 - Sibusiso Mbele
There's a lot of things involved, but I'll just spot a few. Looking at the smart starters, and then you'll find that some of them, they don't understand exactly what is going on. But the moment they have someone to ask questions, clarified things to say, this is why we have to do what we are doing. And then this is how we have to do it. And then it grows them to an extent to say, it's no longer just like taking care of children, but impacting their lives, giving them the values that they need in their lifetime experiences. Something like making their own choices, something like resolving their issues, something like seeking for help within the peers, if it can't help, then they have to approach for the older ones. And then that makes the smart starters become very unique to establish, to say, the program grows. Like the children from their programs, they are being recommended at schools in the area to say, if the children is from that program, and then there are less struggles, more are the successes than struggles. So that is where the smart starters became like, OK, now So if we do this thing right, and then bringing on their table to say, guys, the thing is, it's not about finding out how poor are you or how excellent are you, but building the confidence, implementing the program. And then that's make them to say, they can even reach out and say, Coach, I'm struggling with this one. How can I make it through? Say, OK, call your peer. She or he has, she's an expert on this one, ask her, if you don't get it, then I'm here to help, to, to express that I'm not the only one who's carrying information, but the information is amongst them. It's just not refined amongst them. They don't depend on each other. But the moment they understand, say, Oh, if you go to the Coach, and the Coach refer you to the close up here, and then that means they have the solutions, they have the skills to master the program. So that is, that is a typical thing to say. They are building their strength within themselves amongst themselves to make sure that the program is being implemented to impact the lives of children.

12:33 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. Um, and can you share a story of a practitioner you've coached who really transformed their practice?

12:45 - Sibusiso Mbele
Yes. Uh, looking at the experience, I looked at when they are being recruited. And then they are aware of what to do, but not so sure exactly. But looking at them after they're being recruited, being supported, and then they've grown up. And then you reach a state whereby to say, they are willing to go an extra mile when the challenges come across with their way. For example, looking at one smart starter who secured a sponsor to build at the Centre for her. She was just losing her hope down the line when she was just implementing the program. Parents were supporting the program, but the environment was not that conducive because of some technicalities. And then up until someone popped in and found that they were implementing the program. And then she was impressed with the program, said, no, you cannot implement this program at the space like this. We put it just reach out to you. And they just built a Centre of four separate classrooms that accommodates like eight children or so. And then that made her to look at the whole thing together. Because I always make mention to say, be the best at what you do, wherever you are. And then you'll attract those who will support your idea moving forward. And then that is what bear fruits for her. And then right now, she is a proud smart starter to say, hey, she never knew that joining the program of Smart Start will attract a lot of things towards her direction. And then that made her feel like she has no way, no reason to step away from Smart Start because it's an attractive force of a lot of things towards her. But not towards her per se, but towards what she does for the community.

14:40 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. And now I'm gonna move questions a bit to the franchisor relationship. How do you work with franchisors? What's that relationship like,

14:59 - Sibusiso Mbele
If you say franchisors, looking at where I'm working or another franchisor that we work with towards the program of Smart Start, to be clear.

15:07 - vule Tshvhs
It could be the one you're working with and other ones that you work with towards the program of Smart Start.

15:14 - Sibusiso Mbele
Oh, OK. Looking at, let's see where I'm working. The working relationship is very smooth. We installed this thing that is one of the priorities for Smartstart to say, we work as a team. Individual achievement contributes towards the team achievement. So we value that one very much. All of us, all the coaches, all the members of the team, PL and everyone, one, even the franchisor as a whole, they value what we do, because it does a huge impact towards the society. So the working relationship, I'd say, is the healthy one. And even looking out to other franchisors, because we are working as coaches to say, if ever we're struggling with something, maybe mostly it's not being us asking for help. But you find that others from outside are asking, say, guys, we're struggling with this one. How can we navigate through? It said, OK, it's fine. That one needs so and so to assist you with this one. And then at a later stage, they just pop in and call back and say, no, guys, what your advice you give to us, it worked for us. So that means we have this working relationship that is smooth and it grows the network because everyone focus on the area where they are, but sharing the information with the others. That's what I'd say.

16:42 - vule Tshvhs
OK. And regarding quality challenges, what are the biggest quality challenges you see in early learning practice? How do you address them?

16:56 - Sibusiso Mbele
The quality is a crucial aspect that is key for the whole thing that we are doing for the program that is being implemented. Hugely with the Coach as we as coaches and then the support that we give to the practitioners in a sense to say they don't just have to implement the program trying to make sure that all the boxes are ticked but they must implement the program making sure that the beneficiaries of the program understand it and they are convertible within the program. So how what do I mean by saying that, looking at, say, someone who's not confident in implementing the program. You pop in, you check how far are they, what are they doing, how are they doing it. And then you find that someone is doing something, but not exactly sure what to do. And then you give them a little feedback at the end to say, OK, observed But this was expected. Why do we expect this? Like looking at just a key example, you'll find that someone is implementing a program to a huge group. And then you pop in and say, how do you master the session where you have to ask each child to say, what are you planning to do in the next hour for the playtime? And then you find that they do ask children, but they forget who said what. And then that is why we say, now, you see why we say we should have a limited number of children to ensure that the problem is effective. Yeah, now I know that is why when the Children increases when the space still accommodates Children, but the Children increases, you need to have no assist to make sure that no child remained behind due to the fact that you're trying to cover everyone and then leaving others behind. So that brings the quality in. Now I know to say, Why do we have to give every child a chance or the opportunity to speak? To have a conversation with the child, so that the quality of the program is being embedded to all of them. Not just to say, if the majority is benefiting, then those who are falling behind, it's fine. So just making every child to be valued in the program. So that is where we look at the critical part of it. As coaches, we have a lot to do, because the situation of franchise A is not the same as the challenges of franchise B. But then they have to be integrated to ensure that the qualities is being unleashed to them.

19:34 - vule Tshvhs
Thank you for that. So towards training and evolution, how has Smart Starts training approach changed over the years? What have you learned about what works?

19:52 - Sibusiso Mbele
I have noticed a few things. It's getting better and better. Better from time to time. Looking at different trainings, we have a lot of trainings that are taking place. It's five startup training. It comes to child progress. It comes to business skill. There's a lot of trainings that are taking place. But all of them, the ones that were done prior, although they were informative, they were impacting the lives of practitioners. But the ones that are done now are more efficient than the one that we've done over the years. But not turning a blind eye. Looking at someone who was trained, say, two years ago, and then look at someone who's been trained within a Year. And then you can see the difference to see. The one who's trained lately is more informed and more relevant than the one who was trained a while ago. But making them into clubs to say, guys, we don't have to go like you've been with the Smart Start for the same number of years. There's something you're missing out. So the clubs must be integrated to accommodate everyone. To say, once you attend, you share a club with someone who was not trained with you. Then you learn something from that person. So which is good for the network and its growth. To say, information and knowledge is shared equally, everyone. Amongst all the platforms that we have, amongst all the channels that we have, looking at the reality of the clubs in the local areas.

21:32 - vule Tshvhs
OK. And Smart Start calls itself a platform. From your perspective, what does that mean? And how do you see yourself as part of that platform?

21:49 - Sibusiso Mbele
Yes, Smartstart is a platform, a platform that gives the opportunity to every child to succeed. How? And then the strategy that Smartstart is using to say, we go to the places where people are, where children are, and then we recruit people from that area. And then that is where the platform kicks in to say, if we recruit someone to establish something, with the implementation of the program for Smart Start, that is where everyone will benefit. Okay. And then the support of coaches, we as coaches, going deep down to where the Smart Starters are, where everything that the numbers are talking about as Smart Start are, and then that is where it creates the opportunity, the position, creates the space, empowers the platform to say, you are not alone, even wherever you are. But we have the support structure that will come to you and you'll understand that support structure. Not just to say, you have the program, you are on your own. But keep monitoring to say, now this has to grow. You have to improve from one phase to another. You cannot have smart starters who are struggling with the same problem for the longest But every problem should just come up, and then the solution is generated in the process. Like, for example, if someone says, I'm struggling. I cannot be able to attract children. Say, let us just look at the approach. What happens to the children that you already have? Are they making progress where they are going to? If they are not, then the parents will doubt to bring their children to you. But the moment that your children are being recommended, it pushes the parents to send the children to you. And then you'll end up benefiting in the whole process of the platform of Smart Start. So for us as coaches, we cannot reach every child, but we can reach every franchisee, and the franchisee will reach every child in their closer area. That is where the platform for Smart Start comes in and kicks in.

24:00 - vule Tshvhs
OK, thank you for that. And our next question, what makes your job hard? What gets in the way of supporting practitioners effectively?

24:16 - Sibusiso Mbele
What makes my job hard? It's nothing really except the environments where we operate. Why do I say that? We're with.

29:07 - vule Tshvhs
Hello, good afternoon Mr. Sibusiso. You seem to have been disconnected.

29:12 - vule Tshvhs
I'm trying...

29:18 - vule Tshvhs
I don't know what...

33:45 - Sibusiso Mbele
Hi, you're back. Sorry about that.

33:53 - vule Tshvhs
Not a problem, it happens. I was saying that the network is like this sometimes, so it's important to be patient. OK, so I'm just going to go back to the questions I had opened. We were talking about the franchisor relation, oh, the quality, the training evaluation.

34:24 - Sibusiso Mbele
Oh. What makes our job difficult?

34:27 - vule Tshvhs
Yes, yes, question nine. Yes, you can carry on.

34:30 - Sibusiso Mbele
OK. What makes our job difficult? It's the technicalities and areas where we operate and like for example where we work it's just rural areas you'll find that certain areas you cannot access a network you cannot be able to call the franchisee to say I'm coming by the time you are coming but you have to arrange then you find that you arrive at the place then the franchisee is not there for some emergencies that might okay family matters or whatever personal matters but besides that the other one will be like the natural weather sometimes you'll find that the plan is to cover a certain amount of work at a certain area it just rain non-stop then you cannot be able to about the environment, the roads and the stuff, then does not allow us to operate even if there were, no matter what weather it is. But besides that, the support we have, it is everything that we are doing. Those are just the minor things that challenges us in those moments, but not all the times.

35:55 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. And when you, when you see the impact of your coaching, what does that look like, How do you know it's working?

36:09 - Sibusiso Mbele
When we look at the impact we do as we offer as coaches, then how does it look like, It's like looking at someone, everything that they are doing, if it grows to an extent to say, like, for example, you reach some who's struggling to attract children. And then you shift the focus. Not just to say, no, just keep waiting for them to come. Say, focus on the children that are attending. Let them feel like it's worth it for them to come to the Centre every single day, because every day you have something new for them. That encourages the others, Like, for example, when the children are playing outside in their neighborhood, wherever they are, with the children that they are learning with them in this program, and then they play in a unique way that demonstrate what they do at the Centre. And then the parents recognize, say, these children are not fighting. These children have different values. Where are they getting the values? And then it goes back to say, no, we have And so who's doing this program in our local area? Then everyone recommends. Then you find that someone now say, no, my program is full. I cannot take children anymore. So that makes us as coaches feel like we do the impact that is worth it. And then to an extent, maybe you'll find that even the local schools recommend that for the children to come to school, grade 1s or grade Rs, they must just go to the Centres that are rendering Smartstart program because it plays a vital role to their lives in terms of skills moving forward.

38:02 - vule Tshvhs
OK. All right. And what are you most proud of in your work with Smartstart?

38:11 - Sibusiso Mbele
The most thing I'm proud of working with Smartstart it will be growing the network of Smartstart. Because for me to work for Smartstart, it expanded the networks. There are those that came through my role as a Coach. And supporting the network to say, bringing the stability to the network to say, it does not mean that when you are old in Smartstart, being a franchisee of five years ago, and then you are no longer valued at the moment. They are still valued as if they joined today. But looking at the impact, where are the children going to? Are the children benefiting? So looking at someone to say, for example, if a local school says, bring all your children to our school, and then they'll be first preference than any other children. That's a win for us. It's a proudest moment to say, now we know that when we say, I'm supporting the program of smart start at the Centres, the product, bring evidence themselves to say, here we are, and then we can do this. And then that's the proudest moment for me. Okay.

39:32 - vule Tshvhs
And what do you hope for smart starts training and coaching system over the next 10 years?

What I'm hoping for, looking at the next 10 I can see the numbers. The numbers can be there, but the focus will be not deviating from the values of giving every child the power to succeed. So for the next 10 years, it will be to say if what we were able to do in the last 10 and then it will be more refined for the next 10 to say, uh, every practitioner, every franchise would understand the values of what they are doing more than they understand it today. Which will just make it easy to attract every child in the villages, in the society, to say, go through this program. Your life will be transformed by referring to the children who have been with MassArt for the past 10 years, and then the progress they are making. And then to say, whoever goes through this will make a huge difference. So the trainings that might be relevant for coaches and franchises say we don't have to look at today at where we are. But we'll look.

Smartstart 10-year Report Coach Interview
Coach: Phunyuka Ngwenya

Thu, Feb 5, 2026

0:00 - vule Tshvhs
mentioned, I am working with Auxeira to write the Smart Start 10-year Report. So we need reflections from coaches about their experiences in the past 10 years. So the questions are pretty simple and straightforward and please feel free to share in detail your experiences and as long as we remain very specific and concise and be mindful of the hour that we have. I also wanted to request that I record the meeting for the purpose of reporting and record keeping. Is that okay?

0:49 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, fine.

0:50 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, thank you so much for that. Okay, so the first question is me about your role at Smart Start. What are you doing on the day-to-day?

1:03 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Okay, I am a Coach so most of the days I am in the field supporting the franchises or practitioners in running the Smart Start program. So basically my day is filled with side and admin and driving, a lot of driving, because I need to move from one early learning program to the other. And then I'm also responsible for the planning of how do I reach my people, how do I recruit more people to join Smart Start and to get more people getting more children into their early learning program.

1:58 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. And how did you come to work for Smart Start? What attracted you to this work?

2:08 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
What attracted me, it was the idea of working with the communities. I have passion for children, especially children under the age of five years. And to ensure that they get a good start in life so when I saw the advert and then what the job entailed I thought this is something that I would really love to do instead of being in the fence you know always criticizing why is this not being done this way I thought okay this will give me a platform to make a difference in my community.

2:44 - vule Tshvhs
Okay and this Describe a typical interaction with a practitioner you are coaching. What do you work on together?

2:56 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Okay, in most cases is to assist them with the different areas of the daily routine where they will say, okay, I am doing well in this area and then I am struggling in this. So what I normally do before I go the practitioner, I ask them to do the self-assessment using the form that we provided for them with the play kit. So I would ask them to fill in that form so that when I go to visit, they will look into the areas that they feel they need assistance in. And then I also assist them with the filling in of the admin forms that Smartstart requires. And sending them off because that is one area where we are struggling a lot because half the time, if not 90% of the time, Funda app is not working and there are also issues with having to use systems to fill in information. You type in something and then it doesn't synchronize, it doesn't appear, or the duplication errors that you need to now redo the whole thing so I also assist with the technical issues those sometimes I have to escalate them to the call centre or the IT department.

4:30 - vule Tshvhs
Okay and can you share a story of a practitioner you've coached who really transformed their practice?

4:42 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Yeah, I had one who also came to the, I forgot the name of that conference, who really transformed her practice. Actually, she started as somebody who didn't even have one child in her centre when she came to Smart Start, when she came to Meiji. She was just interested in early learning program environment. So, when she came in, she had the interest, but she didn't know how to start, where to start, what are the requirements. So, after the training, it took her about two weeks for her to get the required three children for conversion. And then After about six months or so, she had about 12 children. And then at the end of the year, she had 20 children. And now she has grown to, I think this year, I haven't received her child registration forms for this year, but by last year, December, she told me that she is at 40 something, the number of children. And then she got more involved. The good thing about the area that she is in, it's new development, mostly with the young families. So there's a lot of children there who would not have had a centre if it was not for her centre there.

6:19 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. And how do you work with franchisors? What's that relationship like,

6:29 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
I am a branch here in Limpopo. Have any other franchisors that we are working with.

6:37 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, OK. And what are the biggest quality challenges you see in early learning practice? How do you address them?

6:49 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
The biggest challenge is mostly with material needs. And you now have to translate something that came in a different language into your own language. And the other issue where I work, it's dual languages most of the places. So in one class, you'll find that there are children who are speaking different languages and then the practitioner need to be able to adjust to that. So we normally use that lab to discuss issues that will help them to improve on the quality of their program, like somebody who would maybe have a know-how of doing things better or in an effective way, then they teach the others.

7:44 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, and how has Smart Starts training approach changed over the years? What have you learned about what works?

7:55 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
I only joined Smartstart about a year ago, so I haven't seen much transformation on the training.

8:07 - Unidentified Speaker
OK.

8:08 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Yeah, it's the same.

8:11 - vule Tshvhs
OK, OK, no problem. I completely understand. And Smartstart calls itself a platform. From your perspective, what does that mean, and how do you see yourself as part of the platform?

8:29 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Okay, Smart Start has got many terms that we use. Sometimes one gets lost to what do they mean by this, but what I see is Smart Start is an area of, what do I call it, it's a place where if you are into early learning development or early childhood development, especially the educational part, although they do look at the child holistically, but to be honest, I feel they are more into the educational part of it than any other areas. So it gives a very good foundation and it's also a support structure for the franchisees, because now they have people who are like-minded in one place, in one room, and because we also help them with starting the clubs, they feel like they are part of a network, they are part of something, and that is motivating, unlike doing things all by yourself in your little corner. And then I see my somebody who is helping and pioneering their smart start vision and making sure that in the ground people get to understand what smart start vision is and also to execute that vision.

9:58 - vule Tshvhs
Okay and what makes your job hard? What gets in the way of supporting practitioners effectively?

10:07 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
The never-ending admin and the duplication of things. Just recently, we've been asked for the centre address. You input this during Smart Spacing, and then you go into the Smart Link, it's not reflecting. You ask yourself, why was I asked to put all those information into a system that keep it safe and readily available for me to use. And I understand we need to improve our systems. We need to change and upgrade and everything. But unfortunately, with that, you get to lose some data. And also, in my area, what I find also to be tedious is that I have a lot of franchises that I need to support, old and new. And it becomes very difficult, especially for the old, who are not in your radar in terms of they're due for any quality assessment. To support them in the time that you have, it's not enough for you to be seeing all these people at the same time and giving them individual attention. Because of that one end up relying mostly on the clubs and the club leaders to assist in ensuring that people are all still on board and also to shout if they need help somewhere. But the other thing is the amount of work, the workload that one as a Coach has versus the time that you have to assist these people. It's so palimented. Like now, when you told me it's an hour-hour Interview, I was like, what? I don't have an hour. I don't have an hour. I got two things that I drew for submission today that I only get to know about them yesterday. So yeah, it gets to be that hectic. And everybody wants a piece of a quote. And they want it now.

12:31 - vule Tshvhs
No, no, no, no. I completely understand. Um, when you see the impact of your coaching, what does that look like and how do you know it's working?

12:44 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Well, I think I get to see the impact mostly when they start sharing their graduation, um, ceremonies, pictures, videos, and sending you messages to say, Coach, I've got so many children who are graduating, what do they send you? A thank you note of some sort to say we are here now. That's when one really gets to reflect back and see, oh, okay, so this is really working and it's helping. And also the confidence that you see from the children when you see the videos of the children and you're like, oh, that is That is me. I'm part of that. I was there to start something, you know. So one gets to really experience that and then reflect at that moment. And one then gets to realize, okay, all that hard work, all those sleepless nights, all the tired days where you just wanted to die, they came to filtration.

13:52 - vule Tshvhs
Okay. And I guess that question ties in very well with the next question that I have. What are you most proud of in your work with Smart Start?

14:06 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
What I'm most proud of is in places where they did the work you, there is no early learning centre around my area. And then you move from children being in the outside and then at the end of the year, now you're getting 10, 15 children into the system. And you get to have created also a job opportunity for somebody who was sitting at home, doing nothing. So yeah that that kind of like brings it back to it is worth it and and when they start showing uh last year I had a club where they were helping each other to paint their early learning centre rooms it was beautiful to watch the transformation you know somebody who would tell you that I started from a cheque and then with the stipend and also the contribution, the profit that they would get from the payment that the parents make, they started buying cement, they made bricks, built the class and then you see them growing like that. It is really touching to see such growth and we've seen that with most of our franchisees. Okay.

15:39 - vule Tshvhs
And looking to the future, what do you hope for Smart Starts training and coaching system over the next decade?

15:50 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
What I'm hoping for is to have a way of continuing to support those who joined Smart Starts as a long time ago, still being supported and getting to run the program well, while we are also increasing the numbers of new franchises. Because right now, we don't have a cap number of how many franchises should a Coach have. And then when do we say this is too much? So that the Coach can give quality support to her franchises. Because in my area, I don't want to lie. I focus mostly on the new ones. The old ones, they are abandoned. I speak to them over the phone. I speak to them over WhatsApp. I meet them maybe once or twice in a year. That's it. And I feel it's not fair on them. I wish I could support them as much as I support the new ones, but the new ones are the ones that are getting most of my attention because they still need to also learn the system and everything that goes with Smart Start. But at the same time, I feel the older ones, I kind of like your abandoned older child, your firstborns that nobody cares about.

17:27 - vule Tshvhs
All right, and we have three remaining questions. How does feedback from smart starters influence the training or coaching you provide? Can you give an example of something that changed because of a practitioner's feedback?

17:48 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Okay, I do take their feedback very serious. Recently, I've started matching their practitioners and I've already have one training, the one that is currently running now, of Smart Starters practitioners. So these are people who joined the Smart Start Centre as assistants and then as the Smart Start grows, they now had their own classes. And then most of the time the franchises tell me that we have people who are working with us, who are working for us, but they are unable to run the program. We try to teach them like we were taught in class, but it's not the same. And we feel they don't really grasp the concept. So when I am not in the centre, it means on that day, the daily program doesn't get to be run effectively. They will do certain things, certain things they will just improvise because they have to run the program. So we would appreciate it if our practitioners could also be trained. So I took that and listened to them as much as I had other people who wanted to come in, who wanted to start, who are your smart starters. I then requested from my manager that I do have people who want to start but I also need to start considering training the practitioners of the Smart Start Centres. And then we agreed that we do the matching for them. And then now we have started to train them. I haven't seen the results yet because they're just in class now. So maybe in six months time, How is it working? Is it helping? Are there any changes or did we just waste our time and money? Yeah.

19:53 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, so this question, the next question, second last question is a bit broad. What makes it possible for Smart Start to support 15,000 practitioners? What would break if you tried to double that number?

20:11 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
What makes it possible? I think it's the networks that Smartstart has, the branches and the franchise rules that are part of Smartstart. The people that are in the ground, they are the ones that are helping a lot. And the reputation, Smartstart is now a brand on its own. The referrals that I get for people to come and join Smartstart They see other Smart Start centres, they talk to other franchises and ask them, how do I become part of your organisation? And almost everyone, even those who do not qualify to be on Smart Start, they come and say, we want to be part of Smart Start. And then one has to explain, OK, in your case, we can only offer you the online training. You're not going to get all the support that the Smart starters have because we are only concentrating on this kind of people. So I think it made a good name of itself and the quality that it gives out there stands and speaks for itself.

21:28 - vule Tshvhs
Okay and our last question, can you share an example of a smart starter who innovated something in their practice that you then shared with other practitioners?

21:43 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
I can't think of anything right now. Okay, not a problem. That really need me to, you'd have gotten this Interview in the morning after my coffee. Okay, I'll think of it while you ask me other things.

22:03 - vule Tshvhs
I just wanted to to reflect back on a question that I think I might have missed about quality challenges. Did we answer that one? What are the biggest quality challenges you see in early learning practice? How do you address them?

22:18 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
I did answer that one. I said mostly it has to do with the dual languages and also using technology versus the understanding of technology and all those.

22:31 - vule Tshvhs
Oh, I see. That is all that I have. I'm hoping we made good on the time so that you can focus on all the tasks that you have. Thank you so much for making the time. Your voice helps us show how Smart Start platform actually works on the ground. I wanted to ask if we can use your name, maybe if we have a quote from anything that you've shared with us, We would like to use your name to say, oh, this is the person who informed us on this, if that is possible.

23:09 - Phunyuka Ngwenya
Yeah, you can use my name is fine.

23:13 - vule Tshvhs
Okay, thank you so much for your time.

23:15 - Unidentified Speaker
Thank you.

23:17 - vule Tshvhs
All right, bye.





Interview transcript: Pumeza Kula (Coach) — Friday 09:00–10:00
Interviewed by Thabi 
1. Role
"Tell me about your role at SmartStart. What do you do day-to-day?"
Pumza: I’m a club coach. Day-to-day, I plan my week and schedule my fieldwork. A big part of my role is supporting franchisees and practitioners through their journey—checking in, visiting, and helping them understand what they need to do at each stage. I also support the club system and work closely with practitioners to help them improve their practice and keep progressing.

2. Journey
"How did you come to work for SmartStart? What attracted you to this work?"
Pumeza: I didn’t start as a coach. I started as an admin assistant. I had left corporate work because I felt it wasn’t what I was meant to do. I joined SmartStart while trying to figure out what direction my life should take.
As I grew up, I always loved teaching—I would teach my younger brothers what they were learning at school. I didn’t realise then that this was a real calling.
When I joined SmartStart, a coach I worked with encouraged coaches to mentor people they saw potential in. I went out into the field, and I immediately felt, “No—this is what I’ve wanted to do my whole life.” I fell in love with working with people and supporting practitioners on the ground.
I always tell my friends: you don’t just wake up and become a coach. If you treat coaching as “just a job,” you won’t succeed. You need passion, and you need to feel called to lead and support others. It has to be something you wake up wanting to do every morning.

3. Practitioner support
"Describe a typical interaction with a practitioner you're coaching. What do you work on together?"
Pumeza: Many practitioners start not knowing what to do in ECD. Some tell us that in other places people don’t really explain clearly or show them the steps. SmartStart becomes the pathway for their ECD journey.
We often onboard people who are unemployed but have a passion and love for children. Some start with just a few children—two, three, maybe four. I support them with what to do after training and how to implement what they’ve learned.
What makes me love this work is seeing them grow: someone starts small, then after coaching and support, they increase their child numbers—sometimes doubling or even tripling. I recently supported a practitioner who was worried because she didn’t have enough children, but when I visited later, she had tripled her numbers and was now planning to extend her space because more children were coming.
For me, that means children aren’t left playing on the street—they’re in a safe early learning space.

4. Transformation stories
"Can you share a story of a practitioner you've coached who really transformed their practice? What changed?"
Pumeza: There are many stories, but one that stands out is a practitioner who almost completed the full SmartStart journey. The journey includes training, conversion, the PQA visit, and further training—like child development and business training. We also support with things like registration, and moving through levels (including silver level).
What stood out about her was that she started with a few children, like many others, but she kept going and grew her numbers. After she completed the silver level work, she received an external visit soon after—she had completed in November and received the visit in December. It showed me that as they grow and improve quality, other support systems start recognising them too. It doesn’t end with just increasing numbers—good work attracts more support and recognition.

5. Franchisor relationship
"How do you work with franchisors? What's that relationship like?"
Pumeza: We have a good relationship. We communicate regularly—when there are issues, we reach out to each other. We’re given space to raise challenges and problem-solve together, and we usually find solutions.
I can honestly say the relationship has improved over time, and management plays a role in that by reinforcing how important coaches are. SmartStart has grown because of coaches—without coaches, the network wouldn’t have reached so many children. When that’s recognised, franchisors are more responsive and supportive when we need help.

6. Quality challenges
"What are the biggest quality challenges you see in early learning practice? How do you address them?"
Pumwza: One big challenge is helping people understand that quality matters and has to be consistent. I often use an example: like a franchise—if you go to KFC, you expect the same taste everywhere. In the same way, quality in ECD must be reliable and consistent.
We talk about quality all the time in the field. We coach on policy and standards and remind practitioners that quality is the foundation.
Another challenge is that some practitioners join other programmes and then get confused or stop applying the SmartStart approach properly. Sometimes they move between programmes and forget what to do.
We also get people who join for the wrong reasons—just for the stipend or the kit, not for the learning or quality. We can usually spot this over time: they don’t attend sessions consistently, they avoid meetings, or they don’t participate properly. When we identify those cases, we increase visits and ask club or cluster leadership to keep an eye on them and support accountability.

7. Training evolution
"How has SmartStart's training approach changed over the years? What have you learned about what works?"
Pumeza: Training has improved a lot—there are changes regularly, and it helps people understand the programme better. Over time, fewer people need to be re-taught from scratch. We still expect that at the beginning people won’t grasp everything immediately, because it’s new. But later on, you can clearly see progress.
Now, when we do observations and assessments, it’s more common to see people performing at a stronger level than before, which shows that the training improvements are working.

8. Platform role
"SmartStart calls itself a 'platform.' From your perspective, what does that mean? How do you see yourself as part of the platform?"
Pumeza: For me, SmartStart is a platform because it doesn’t only build practitioners—it also builds coaches and even changes how we see children and people.
One of the biggest things SmartStart teaches is that children must be allowed to express themselves and be asked how they feel. I compare it to how I grew up: we didn’t express ourselves—children were scared and couldn’t speak freely. That affects confidence and self-esteem.
SmartStart built my confidence too. I used to be shy and scared to speak, but through the training and the environment, I became confident enough to do interviews like this and to support others.
So I see myself as part of the platform because I’m not only supporting franchisees and children—I’m part of a system that develops people, builds confidence, and shifts how early learning is approached in communities.

9. Barriers
"What makes your job hard? What gets in the way of supporting practitioners effectively?"
Pumeza: What makes the job hard is when I plan a visit and a practitioner cancels at the last minute, or refuses to allow me to visit—even after training. Sometimes they avoid support because they feel shy or embarrassed that they’re not doing the programme correctly.
That breaks my heart because I don’t want to leave someone behind with low understanding. I want them to speak up early so I can give them more time and support.
We have spaces like coaching circles where they can raise their hand and say they don’t understand. I expect honesty there. When someone avoids support, I worry they won’t make progress.
For me, it’s not about perfection—it’s about improvement. I want them to share progress so we can celebrate growth, because that’s the SmartStart way.

10. Impact
"When you see the impact of your coaching, what does that look like? How do you know it's working?"
Pumeza: I know it’s working when I see growth—especially when a practitioner starts with two or three children and then grows their numbers. Often, they take advice from coaching circles, club meetings, and coaching visits, and then you see the results: they recruit more children, their centre becomes more stable, and sometimes they even extend their space because demand increases.
That’s the real sign: growth in numbers, growth in confidence, and growth in how they run the programme.

11. Pride
"What are you most proud of in your work with SmartStart?"
Pumeza: I’m proud of making change in the community. I’m proud of changing another person’s life—especially helping women build confidence. Many start shy, scared to speak, scared to stand in front of people, and over time they become stronger and more confident.
So my pride is not only that they learn the programme, but that they become more confident human beings. That change matters.

12. Future
"What do you hope for SmartStart's training and coaching system over the next decade?"
Pumeza: I hope SmartStart grows much bigger—so that we reach far more children. My hope is that we clean up the streets in the sense that we don’t have young children—three and four-year-olds—left at home or on the street with no early learning.
Many parents struggle because of money. Some children come with no food, and practitioners end up trying to provide breakfast or lunch. I hope SmartStart gets more funding so practitioners can be supported properly, especially those working with children who can’t pay fees.
I also hope communities understand the importance of starting early learning early. Many parents still think school starts at Grade R or Grade 1, but then children struggle and get labelled as “slow.” If children get stimulation at 3 and 4, they’re more ready for Grade 1, they perform better, and they don’t get isolated or discouraged.

13. Feedback loops
"How does feedback from SmartStarters influence the training or coaching you provide? Can you give an example of something that changed because of practitioner feedback?"
Pumeza: Feedback influences me personally because when a SmartStarter leaves the programme, I reflect on what went wrong and what I could have done differently. I don’t like to see people leave, because I know how valuable the programme is.
But I’ve learned that the programme is not for everyone. Some join with excitement at the beginning, then later they leave because they found a job, or because the stipend ended, or because they joined for the wrong reasons (money or the kit). Those cases are painful, but they also help us understand who needs closer monitoring and support.
At the same time, the majority stay because they love the programme and see results—children enjoy it, parents give positive feedback, and practitioners become known in the community for quality. Some practitioners have been in the programme for many years and still speak positively about it.
So feedback helps us identify who needs more support, who is committed, and how to strengthen accountability so fewer people drop off.

14. Scale enablers
"What makes it possible for SmartStart to support 15,000 practitioners? What would break if you tried to double that number?"
Pumeza: I think it’s possible to double, but it would require much more time in the field. We would need more community engagement—meeting councils, meeting community leaders, going area to area, even door-to-door.
From what I see, there is still a large need and a lot of ground not yet covered. If we want to double, we need to spend less time in the office and more time on the ground recruiting and supporting practitioners.

15. Innovation from practitioners
"Can you share an example of a SmartStarter who innovated something in their practice that you then shared with other practitioners?"
Pumeza: One example that stood out recently was when the Department of Basic Education called two SmartStarters to join a big event where they received a container of Lego. That was new and exciting for me. Photos were taken, and they appeared on the front page of a newspaper. It showed that SmartStarters are being recognised publicly and that the work is meaningful and visible beyond our programme.
Pumeza: Thank you for choosing me. I hope everything goes well with the report.
